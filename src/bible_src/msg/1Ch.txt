4.10 Jabez prayed to the God of Israel: "Bless me, O bless me! Give me land, large tracts of land. And provide your personal protection - don't let evil hurt me." God gave him what he asked.

4.26 The sons of Mishma: Hammuel had Zaccur and Zaccur had Shimei.
4.27 Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers were not nearly as prolific and never became a large family like Judah.

4.29 Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad,

4.38 - all these were the leaders in their families. They prospered and increased in numbers
4.39 so that they had to go as far as Gedor (Gerar) to the east of the valley looking for pasture for their flocks.
4.40 And they found it - lush pasture, lots of elbow room, peaceful and quiet.
4.41 But the men in these family trees came when Hezekiah was king of Judah and attacked the Hamites, tearing down their tents and houses. There was nothing left of them, as you can see today. Then they moved in and took over because of the great pastureland.
4.42 Five hundred of these Simeonites went on and invaded the hill country of Seir, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.
4.43 They killed all the escaped Amalekites who were still around. And they still live there.
5.1 The family of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Though Reuben was Israel's firstborn, after he slept with his father's concubine, a defiling act, his rights as the firstborn were passed on to the sons of Joseph son of Israel. He lost his "firstborn" place in the family tree.
5.2 And even though Judah became the strongest of his brothers and King David  eventually came from that family, the firstborn rights stayed with Joseph.
5.3 The sons of Reuben, firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
5.4 The descendants of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,

5.8 then Bela son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel. Joel lived in the area from Aroer to Nebo and Baal Meon.
5.9 His family occupied the land up to the edge of the desert that goes all the way to the Euphrates River, since their growing herds of livestock spilled out of Gilead.
5.10 During Saul's reign they fought and defeated the Hagrites; they then took over their tents and lived in them on the eastern frontier of Gilead.
5.11 The family of Gad were their neighbors in Bashan, as far as Salecah:
5.12 Joel was the chief, Shapham the second-in-command, and then Janai, the judge in Bashan.
5.13 Their brothers, by families, were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber - seven in all.
5.14 These were the sons of Abihail son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz.
5.15 Ahi son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was head of their family.
5.16 The family of Gad lived in Gilead and Bashan, including the outlying villages and extending as far as the pastures of Sharon.
5.17 They were all written into the official family tree during the reigns of Jotham king of Judah and Jeroboam king of Israel.
5.18 The families of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 men trained for war - physically fit and skilled in handling shield, sword, and bow.
5.19 They fought against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.
5.20 God helped them as they fought. God handed the Hagrites and all their allies over to them, because they cried out to him during the battle. God answered their prayers because they trusted him.
5.21 They plundered the Hagrite herds and flocks: 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, and 2,000 donkeys. They also captured 100,000 people.
5.22 Many were killed, because the battle was God's. They lived in that country until the exile.
5.23 The half-tribe of Manasseh had a large population. They occupied the land from Bashan to Baal Hermon, that is, to Senir (Mount Hermon).
5.24 The heads of their families were Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel - brave warriors, famous, and heads of their families.
5.25 But they were not faithful to the God of their ancestors. They took up with the ungodly gods of the peoples of the land whom God had gotten rid of before they arrived.
5.26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria) to take the families of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. He deported them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river of Gozan. They've been there ever since.

6.32 They were the ministers of music in the place of worship, which was the Tent of Meeting until Solomon built The Temple of God in Jerusalem. As they carried out their work, they followed the instructions given to them.

8.39 His brother Eshek's sons were Ulam his firstborn, followed by Jeush and Eliphelet.
8.40 Ulam's sons were warriors well known as archers. They had lots of sons and grandsons - at least 150. These were all in Benjamin's family tree.
9.1 This is the complete family tree for all Israel, recorded in the Royal Annals of the Kings of Israel and Judah at the time they were exiled to Babylon because of their unbelieving and disobedient lives.
9.2 The first Israelites to return from exile to their homes and cities were the priests, the Levites, and the temple support staff.
9.3 Returning to Jerusalem from the families of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh were the following:
9.4 Uthai son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, from the line of Perez son of Judah;
9.5 from the Shilonites were Asaiah the firstborn and his sons;
9.6 from the family of Zerah there was Jeuel. There were 690 in the Judah group.

9.8 and Ibneiah son of Jeroham, and Elah son of Uzzi, the son of Micri, and Meshullam son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah.
9.9 There were 956 in the Benjamin group. All these named were heads of families.

9.11 Azariah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, who was in charge of taking care of the house of God;

9.16 also Obadiah son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun; and finally Berekiah son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, who lived in the villages of the Netophathites.
9.17 The security guards were Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their brothers. Shallum was the chief
9.18 and up to now the security guard at the King's Gate on the east. They also served as security guards at the camps of Levite families.
9.19 Shallum son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, along with his brothers in the Korahite family, were in charge of the services of worship as doorkeepers of the Tent, as their ancestors had guarded the entrance to the camp of God.
9.20 In the early days, Phinehas son of Eleazar was in charge of the security guards - God be with him!
9.21 Now Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the security guard at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.
9.22 The number of those who had been chosen to be security guards was 212 - they were officially registered in their own camps. David and Samuel the seer handpicked them for their dependability.
9.23 They and their sons had the permanent responsibility for guarding the gates of God's house, the house of worship;
9.24 the main security guards were posted at the four entrances, east, west, north, and south;
9.25 their brothers in the villages were scheduled to give them relief weekly - the four main security guards were responsible for round-the-clock surveillance.
9.26 Being Levites, they were responsible for the security of all supplies and valuables in the house of God.
9.27 They kept watch all through the night and had the key to open the doors each morning.
9.28 Some were in charge of the articles used in The Temple worship - they counted them both when they brought them in and when they took them out.
9.29 Others were in charge of supplies in the sanctuary - flour, wine, oil, incense, and spices.
9.30 And some of the priests were assigned to mixing the oils for the perfume.
9.31 The Levite Mattithiah, the firstborn son of Shallum the Korahite, was responsible for baking the bread for the services of worship.
9.32 Some of the brothers, sons of the Kohathites, were assigned to preparing the bread set out on the table each Sabbath.
9.33 And then there were the musicians, all heads of Levite families. They had permanent living quarters in The Temple; because they were on twenty-four-hour duty,
9.34 they were exempt from all other duties. These were the heads of Levite families as designated in their family tree. They lived in Jerusalem.
9.35 Jeiel the father of Gibeon lived at Gibeon; his wife was Maacah.
9.36 His firstborn son was Abdon, followed by Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab,
9.37 Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth.
9.38 Mikloth had Shimeam. They lived in the same neighborhood as their relatives in Jerusalem.
9.39 Ner had Kish, Kish had Saul, Saul had Jonathan, Malki-Shua, Abinadab, and Esh-Baal.
9.40 Merib-Baal was the son of Jonathan and Merib-Baal had Micah.
9.41 Micah's sons were Pithon, Melech, and Tahrea.
9.42 Ahaz had Jarah, Jarah had Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri; Zimri had Moza,
9.43 Moza had Binea, Rephaiah was his son, Eleasah was his son, and Azel was his son.
9.44 Azel had six sons: Azrikam, Bokeru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan - the sons of Azel.
10.1 The Philistines went to war against Israel; the Israelites ran for their lives from the Philistines but fell, slaughtered on Mount Gilboa.
10.2 The Philistines zeroed in on Saul and his sons and killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua.
10.3 The battle went hard against Saul - the archers found him and wounded him.
10.4 Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and finish me off before these pagan pigs get to me and make a sport of my body." But his armor bearer, restrained by both reverence and fear, wouldn't do it.
10.5 The armor bearer, panicked because Saul was dead, then killed himself.
10.6 So Saul and his three sons - all four the same day - died.
10.7 When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and ran off; the Philistines came and moved in.
10.8 The next day the Philistines came to plunder the dead bodies and found Saul and his sons dead on Mount Gilboa.
10.9 They stripped Saul, removed his head and his armor, and put them on exhibit throughout Philistia, reporting the victory news to their idols and the people.
10.10 Then they put Saul's armor on display in the temple of their gods and placed his skull as a trophy in the temple of their god Dagon.
10.11 The people of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul.
10.12 All of their fighting men went into action - retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh, gave them a dignified burial under the oak at Jabesh, and mourned their deaths for seven days.
10.13 Saul died in disobedience, disobedient to God. He didn't obey God's words. Instead of praying, he went to a witch to seek guidance.
10.14 Because he didn't go to God for help, God took his life and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
11.1 Then all Israel assembled before David at Hebron. "Look at us," they said. "We're your very flesh and blood.
11.2 In the past, yes, even while Saul was king, you were the real leader of Israel. God told you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel; you are to be the ruler of my people Israel.'"
11.3 When all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron,  David made a covenant with them in the presence of God at Hebron. Then they anointed David king over Israel exactly as God had commanded through Samuel.
11.4 David and all Israel went to Jerusalem (it was the old Jebus, where the Jebusites lived).
11.5 The citizens of Jebus told David, "No trespassing - you can't come here." David came on anyway and captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.
11.6 David had said, "The first person to kill a Jebusite will be commander-in-chief." Joab son of Zeruiah was the first; and he became the chief.
11.7 David took up residence in the fortress city; that's how it got its name, "City of David."
11.8 David fortified the city all the way around, both the outer bulwarks (the Millo) and the outside wall. Joab rebuilt the city gates.
11.9 David's stride became longer, his embrace larger - yes, God-of-the-Angel-Armies was with him!
11.10 These are the chiefs of David's Mighty Men, the ones who linked arms with him as he took up his kingship, with all Israel joining in, helping him become king in just the way God had spoken regarding Israel.
11.11 The list of David's Mighty Men:  Jashobeam son of Hacmoni was chief of the Thirty. Singlehandedly he killed three hundred men, killed them all in one skirmish.
11.12 Next was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the Big Three of the Mighty Men.
11.13 He was with David at Pas Dammim, where the Philistines had mustered their troops for battle. It was an area where there was a field of barley. The army started to flee from the Philistines
11.14 and then took its stand right in that field - and turned the tide! They slaughtered the Philistines, God helping them - a huge victory.
11.15 The Big Three from the Thirty made a rocky descent to David at the Cave of Adullam while a company of Philistines was camped in the Valley of Rephaim.
11.16 David was holed up in the Cave while the Philistines were prepared for battle at Bethlehem.
11.17 David had a sudden craving: "What I wouldn't give for a drink of water from the well in Bethlehem, the one at the gate!"
11.18 The Three penetrated the Philistine camp, drew water from the well at the Bethlehem gate, shouldered it, and brought it to David. And then David wouldn't drink it! He poured it out as a sacred offering to God,
11.19 saying, "I'd rather be damned by God than drink this! It would be like drinking the lifeblood of these men - they risked their lives to bring it." So he refused to drink it. These are the kinds of things that the Big Three of the Mighty Men did.
11.20 Abishai brother of Joab was the chief of the Thirty. Singlehandedly he fought three hundred men, and killed the lot, but he never made it into the circle of the Three.
11.21 He was highly honored by the Thirty - he was their chief - still, he didn't measure up to the Three.
11.22 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a Mighty Man from Kabzeel with many exploits to his credit: he killed two famous Moabites; he climbed down into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day;
11.23 and he killed an Egyptian, a giant seven and a half feet tall. The Egyptian had a spear like a ship's boom but Benaiah went at him with a mere club, tore the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with it.
11.24 These are some of the things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did. But he was never included with the Three.
11.25 He was highly honored among the Thirty, but didn't measure up to the Three. David put him in charge of his personal bodyguard.
11.26 The Mighty Men of the military were Asahel brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
11.27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,
11.28 Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite,
11.29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
11.30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite,
11.31 Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjaminite, Benaiah the Pirathonite,
11.32 Hurai from the ravines of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,
11.33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
11.34 the sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,
11.35 Ahiam son of Sacar the Haranite, Eliphal son of Ur,
11.36 Hepher the Mekerathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,
11.37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai son of Ezbai,
11.38 Joel brother of Nathan, Mibhar son of Hagri,
11.39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armor bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
11.40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,
11.41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad son of Ahlai,
11.42 Adina son of Shiza the Reubenite, the Reubenite chief of the Thirty,
11.43 Hanan son of Maacah, Joshaphat the Mithnite,
11.44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,
11.45 Jediael son of Shimri, Joha the Tizite his brother,
11.46 Eliel the Mahavite, Jeribai and Joshaviah the sons of Elnaam, Ithmah the Moabite,
11.47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
12.1 These are the men who joined David in Ziklag; it was during the time he was banished by Saul the son of Kish; they were among the Mighty Men, good fighters.
12.2 They were armed with bows and could sling stones and shoot arrows either right- or left-handed. They hailed from Saul's tribe, Benjamin.
12.3 The first was Ahiezer; then Joash son of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite;
12.4 Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a Mighty Man among the Thirty, a leader of the Thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan; Jozabad the Gederathite;
12.5 Eluzai; Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite;
12.6 Elkanah; Isshiah; Azarel; Joezer; Jashobeam; the Korahites;
12.7 and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
12.8 There were some Gadites there who had defected to David at his wilderness fortress; they were seasoned and eager fighters who knew how to handle shield and spear. They were wild in appearance, like lions, but as agile as gazelles racing across the hills.
12.9 Ezer was the first, then Obadiah, Eliab,
12.10 Mishmannah, Jeremiah,
12.11 Attai, Eliel,
12.12 Johanan, Elzabad,
12.13 Jeremiah, and Macbannai - eleven of them.
12.14 These Gadites were the cream of the crop - any one of them was worth a hundred lesser men, and the best of them were worth a thousand.
12.15 They were the ones who crossed the Jordan when it was at flood stage in the first month, and put everyone in the lowlands to flight, both east and west.
12.16 There were also men from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah who joined David in his wilderness fortress.
12.17 When David went out to meet them, this is what he said: "If you have come in peace and to help me, you are most welcome to join this company; but if you have come to betray me to my enemies, innocent as I am, the God of our ancestors will see through you and bring judgment on you."
12.18 Just then Amasai chief of the Thirty, moved by God's Spirit, said,  We're on your side, O David, We're committed, O son of Jesse; All is well, yes, all is well with you, And all's well with whoever helps you. Yes, for your God has helped and does help you. So David took them on and assigned them a place under the chiefs of the raiders.
12.19 Some from the tribe of Manasseh also defected to David when he started out with the Philistines to go to war against Saul. In the end, they didn't actually fight because the Philistine leaders, after talking it over, sent them home, saying, "We can't trust them with our lives - they'll betray us to their master Saul."
12.20 The men from Manasseh who defected to David at Ziklag were Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, all leaders among the families of Manasseh.
12.21 They helped David in his raids against the desert bandits; they were all stalwart fighters and good leaders among his raiders.
12.22 Hardly a day went by without men showing up to help - it wasn't long before his band seemed as large as God's own army!
12.23 Here are the statistics on the battle-seasoned warriors who came down from the north to David at Hebron to hand over Saul's kingdom, in accord with God's word:
12.24 from Judah, carrying shield and spear, 6,800 battle-ready;
12.25 from Simeon, 7,100 stalwart fighters;
12.26 from Levi, 4,600,
12.27 which included Jehoiada leader of the family of Aaron, bringing 3,700 men
12.28 and the young and stalwart Zadok with twenty-two leaders from his family;
12.29 from Benjamin, Saul's family, 3,000, most of whom had stuck it out with Saul until now;
12.30 from Ephraim, 20,800, fierce fighters and famous in their hometowns;
12.31 from the half-tribe of Manasseh, 18,000 elected to come and make David king;
12.32 from Issachar, men who understood both the times and Israel's duties, 200 leaders with their families;
12.33 from Zebulun, 50,000 well-equipped veteran warriors, unswervingly loyal;
12.34 from Naphtali, 1,000 chiefs leading 37,000 men heavily armed;
12.35 from Dan, 28,600 battle-ready men;
12.36 from Asher, 40,000 veterans, battle-ready;
12.37 and from East of Jordan, men from Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, heavily armed, 120,000.
12.38 All these soldiers came to David at Hebron, ready to fight if necessary; they were both united and determined to make David king over all Israel. And everyone else in Israel was of the same mind - "Make David king!"
12.39 They were with David for three days of feasting celebration, with food and drink supplied by their families.
12.40 Neighbors ranging from as far north as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali arrived with donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen loaded down with food for the party: flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep - joy in Israel! David Goes to Get the Chest of God
13.1 David consulted with all of his leaders, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds.
13.2 Then David addressed the entire assembly of Israel, "If it seems right to you, and it is God's will, let's invite all our relatives wherever they are throughout Israel, along with their relatives, including their priests and Levites from their cities and surrounding pastures, to join us.
13.3 And let's bring the Chest of our God back - the Chest that was out of sight, out of mind during the days of Saul."
13.4 The entire assembly of Israel agreed - everybody agreed that it was the right thing to do.
13.5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Egypt's Pond of Horus in the southwest to the Pass of Hamath in the northeast, to go and get the Chest of God from Kiriath Jearim.
13.6 Then David and all Israel went to Baalah (Kiriath Jearim) in Judah to bring back the Chest of God, the "Cherubim-Throne-of-God," where God's Name is invoked.
13.7 They moved the Chest of God on a brand-new cart from the house of Abinadab with Uzzah and Ahio in charge.
13.8 In procession with the Chest of God, David and all Israel worshiped exuberantly in song and dance, with a marching band of all kinds of instruments.
13.9 When they were at the threshing floor of Kidon, the oxen stumbled and Uzzah grabbed the Chest to keep it from falling off.
13.10 God erupted in anger against Uzzah and killed him because he grabbed the Chest. He died on the spot - in the presence of God.
13.11 David lost his temper, angry because God exploded against Uzzah; the place is still called Perez Uzzah (Exploded Uzzah).
13.12 David was terrified of God that day; he said, "How can I possibly continue this parade with the Chest of God?"
13.13 So David called off the parade of the Chest to the City of David; instead he stored it in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
13.14 The Chest of God was in storage in the house of Obed-Edom for three months. God blessed the family of Obed-Edom and everything around him.
14.1 King Hiram of Tyre sent an envoy to David, along with cedar lumber, masons, and carpenters to build him a royal palace.
14.2 Then David knew for sure that God had confirmed him as king over Israel, because of the rising reputation that God was giving his kingdom for the benefit of his people Israel.
14.3 David married more wives and had more children in Jerusalem.
14.4 His children born in Jerusalem were Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
14.5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
14.6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
14.7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
14.8 The minute the Philistines heard that David had been made king over a united Israel, they went out in force to capture David. When David got the report, he marched out to confront them.
14.9 On their way, the Philistines stopped off to plunder the Valley of Rephaim.
14.10 David prayed to God: "Is this the right time to attack the Philistines? Will you give me the victory?"  God answered, "Attack; I'll give you the victory."
14.11 David attacked at Baal Perazim and slaughtered them. David said, "God exploded my enemies, as water explodes from a burst pipe." That's how the place got its name, Baal Perazim (Baal-Explosion).
14.12 The Philistines left their gods behind and David ordered that they be burned up.
14.13 And then the Philistines were back at it again, plundering in the valley.
14.14 David again prayed to God. God answered, "This time don't attack head-on; circle around and come at them out of the balsam grove.
14.15 When you hear a sound like shuffling feet in the tops of the balsams, attack; God will be two steps ahead of you, slaughtering the Philistines."
14.16 David did exactly as God commanded, slaughtering Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
14.17 David was soon famous all over the place, far and near; and God put the fear of God into the godless nations.
15.1 After David built houses for himself in the City of David, he cleared a place for the Chest and pitched a tent for it.
15.2 Then David gave orders: "No one carries the Chest of God except the Levites; God designated them and them only to carry the Chest of God and be available full time for service in the work of worship."
15.3 David then called everyone in Israel to assemble in Jerusalem to bring up the Chest of God to its specially prepared place.
15.4 David also called in the family of Aaron and the Levites.
15.5 From the family of Kohath, Uriel the head with 120 relatives;
15.6 from the family of Merari, Asaiah the head with 220 relatives;
15.7 from the family of Gershon, Joel the head with 130 relatives;
15.8 from the family of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the head with 200 relatives;
15.9 from the family of Hebron, Eliel the head with 80 relatives;
15.10 from the family of Uzziel, Amminadab the head with 112 relatives.
15.11 Then David called in Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab the Levites.
15.12 He said, "You are responsible for the Levitical families; now consecrate yourselves, both you and your relatives, and bring up the Chest of the God of Israel to the place I have set aside for it.
15.13 The first time we did this, you Levites did not carry it properly, and God exploded in anger at us because we didn't make proper preparation and follow instructions."
15.14 So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the Chest of the God of Israel.
15.15 The Levites carried the Chest of God exactly as Moses, instructed by God, commanded - carried it with poles on their shoulders, careful not to touch it with their hands.
15.16 David ordered the heads of the Levites to assign their relatives to sing in the choir, accompanied by a well-equipped marching band, and fill the air with joyful sound.
15.17 The Levites assigned Heman son of Joel, and from his family, Asaph son of Berekiah, then Ethan son of Kushaiah from the family of Merari,
15.18 and after them in the second rank their brothers Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel as security guards.
15.19 The members of the choir and marching band were: Heman, Asaph, and Ethan with bronze cymbals;
15.20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah with lyres carrying the melody;
15.21 Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah with harps filling in the harmony;
15.22 Kenaniah, the Levite in charge of music, a very gifted musician, was music director.
15.23 Berekiah and Elkanah were porters for the Chest.
15.24 The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer blew the trumpets before the Chest of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also porters for the Chest.
15.25 Now they were ready. David, the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands started out to get the Chest of the Covenant of God and bring it up from the house of Obed-Edom. And they went rejoicing.
15.26 Because God helped the Levites, strengthening them as they carried the Chest of the Covenant of God, they paused to worship by sacrificing seven bulls and seven rams.
15.27 They were all dressed in elegant linen - David, the Levites carrying the Chest, the choir and band, and Kenaniah who was directing the music. David also wore a linen prayer shawl (called an ephod).
15.28 On they came, all Israel on parade bringing up the Chest of the Covenant of God, shouting and cheering, playing every kind of brass and percussion and string instrument.
15.29 When the Chest of the Covenant of God entered the City of David, Michal, Saul's daughter, was watching from a window. When she saw King David dancing ecstatically she was filled with contempt.
16.1 They brought the Chest of God and placed it right in the center of the tent that David had pitched for it; then they worshiped by presenting burnt offerings and peace offerings to God.
16.2 When David had completed the offerings of worship, he blessed the people in the name of God.
16.3 Then he passed around to every one there, men and women alike, a loaf of bread, a slice of barbecue, and a raisin cake.
16.4 Then David assigned some of the Levites to the Chest of God to lead worship - to intercede, give thanks, and praise the God of Israel.
16.5 Asaph was in charge; under him were Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, who played the musical instruments. Asaph was on percussion.
16.6 The priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets before the Chest of the Covenant of God at set times through the day.
16.7 That was the day that David inaugurated regular worship of praise to God, led by Asaph and his company.
16.8 Thank God! Call out his Name! Tell the whole world who he is and what he's done!
16.9 Sing to him! Play songs for him! Broadcast all his wonders!
16.10 Revel in his holy Name, God-seekers, be jubilant!
16.11 Study God and his strength, seek his presence day and night;
16.12 Remember all the wonders he performed, the miracles and judgments that came out of his mouth.
16.13 Seed of Israel his servant! Children of Jacob, his first choice!
16.14 He is God, our God; wherever you go you come on his judgments and decisions.
16.15 He keeps his commitments across thousands  of generations, the covenant he commanded,
16.16 The same one he made with Abraham, the very one he swore to Isaac;
16.17 He posted it in big block letters to Jacob,  this eternal covenant with Israel:
16.18 "I give you the land of Canaan, this is your inheritance;
16.19 Even though you're not much to look at, a few straggling strangers."
16.20 They wandered from country to country, camped out in one kingdom after another;
16.21 But he didn't let anyone push them around, he stood up for them against bully-kings:
16.22 "Don't you dare touch my anointed ones, don't lay a hand on my prophets."
16.23 Sing to God, everyone and everything! Get out his salvation news every day!
16.24 Publish his glory among the godless nations, his wonders to all races and religions.
16.25 And why? Because God is great - well worth praising! No god or goddess comes close in honor.
16.26 All the popular gods are stuff and nonsense, but God made the cosmos!
16.27 Splendor and majesty flow out of him, strength and joy fill his place.
16.28 Shout Bravo! to God, families of the peoples, in awe of the Glory, in awe of the Strength: Bravo!
16.29 Shout Bravo! to his famous Name, lift high an offering and enter his presence! Stand resplendent in his robes of holiness!
16.30 God is serious business, take him seriously; he's put the earth in place and it's not moving.
16.31 So let heaven rejoice, let earth be jubilant, and pass the word among the nations, "God reigns!"
16.32 Let Ocean, all teeming with life, bellow, let Field and all its creatures shake the rafters;
16.33 Then the trees in the forest will add their applause to all who are pleased and present before God  - he's on his way to set things right!
16.34 Give thanks to God - he is good and his love never quits.
16.35 Say, "Save us, Savior God, round us up and get us out of these godless places, So we can give thanks to your holy Name, and bask in your life of praise."
16.36 Blessed be God, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Then everybody said, "Yes! Amen!" and "Praise God!"
16.37 David left Asaph and his coworkers with the Chest of the Covenant of God and in charge of the work of worship; they were responsible for the needs of worship around the clock.
16.38 He also assigned Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight relatives to help them. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah were in charge of the security guards.
16.39 The priest Zadok and his family of priests were assigned to the Tent of God at the sacred mound at Gibeon
16.40 to make sure that the services of morning and evening worship were conducted daily, complete with Whole-Burnt-Offerings offered on the Altar of Burnt Offering, as ordered in the Law of God, which was the norm for Israel.
16.41 With them were Heman, Jeduthun, and others specifically named, with the job description: "Give thanks to God, for his love never quits!"
16.42 Heman and Jeduthun were also well equipped with trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments for accompanying sacred songs. The sons of Jeduthun formed the security guard.
16.43 Arrangements completed, the people all left for home. And David went home to bless his family.
17.1 After the king had made himself at home, he said to Nathan the prophet, "Look at this: Here I am comfortable in a luxurious palace of cedar and the Chest of the Covenant of God sits under a tent."
17.2 Nathan told David, "Whatever is on your heart, go and do it; God is with you."
17.3 But that night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
17.4 "Go and tell my servant David, This is God's word on the matter: You will not build me a 'house' to live in.
17.5 Why, I haven't lived in a 'house' from the time I brought up the children of Israel from Egypt till now; I've gone from one tent and makeshift shelter to another.
17.6 In all my travels with all Israel, did I ever say to any of the leaders I commanded to shepherd Israel, 'Why haven't you built me a house of cedar?'
17.7 "So here is what you are to tell my servant David: The God-of-the-Angel-Armies has this word for you: I took you from the pasture, tagging after sheep, and made you prince over my people Israel.
17.8 I was with you everywhere you went and mowed your enemies down before you; and now I'm about to make you famous, ranked with the great names on earth.
17.9 I'm going to set aside a place for my people Israel and plant them there so they'll have their own home and not be knocked around anymore; nor will evil nations afflict them as they always have,
17.10 even during the days I set judges over my people Israel. And finally, I'm going to conquer all your enemies.
17.11 When your life is complete and you're buried with your ancestors, then I'll raise up your child to succeed you, a child from your own body, and I'll firmly establish his rule.
17.12 He will build a house to honor me, and I will guarantee his kingdom's rule forever.
17.13 I'll be a father to him, and he'll be a son to me. I will never remove my gracious love from him as I did from the one who preceded you.
17.14 I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will always be there, rock solid."
17.15 Nathan gave David a complete and accurate report of everything he heard and saw in the vision.
17.16 King David went in, took his place before God, and prayed:
17.17 But that's nothing compared to what's coming, for you've also spoken of my family far into the future, given me a glimpse into tomorrow and looked on me, Master God, as a Somebody.
17.18 What's left for David to say to this - to your honoring your servant, even though you know me, just as I am?
17.19 O God, out of the goodness of your heart, you've taken your servant to do this great thing and put your great work on display.
17.20 There's none like you, God, no God but you, nothing to compare with what we've heard with our own ears.
17.21 And who is like your people, like Israel, a nation unique on earth, whom God set out to redeem as his own people (and became most famous for it), performing great and fearsome acts, throwing out nations and their gods left and right as you saved your people from Egypt?
17.22 You established for yourself a people - your very own Israel! - your people forever. And you, God, became their God.
17.23 So now, great God, this word that you have spoken to me and my family, guarantee it forever! Do exactly what you've promised!
17.24 Then your reputation will be confirmed and flourish always as people exclaim, "The God-of-the-Angel-Armies, the God over Israel, is Israel's God!" And the house of your servant David will remain rock solid under your watchful presence.
17.25 You, my God, have told me plainly, "I will build you a house." That's how I was able to find the courage to pray this prayer to you.
17.26 God, being the God you are, you have spoken all these wonderful words to me.
17.27 As if that weren't enough, you've blessed my family so that it will continue in your presence always. Because you have blessed it, God, it's really blessed - blessed for good!
18.1 In the days that followed, David struck hard at the Philistines, bringing them to their knees, captured Gath, and took control of the surrounding countryside.
18.2 He also fought and defeated Moab. The Moabites came under David's rule and paid regular tribute.
18.3 On his way to restore his sovereignty at the Euphrates River, David defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah (over toward Hamath).
18.4 David captured a thousand chariots, 7,000 cavalry, and 20,000 infantry from him. He hamstrung all the chariot horses, but saved back a hundred.
18.5 When the Arameans from Damascus came to the aid of Hadadezer king of Zobah, David killed 22,000 of them.
18.6 David set up a puppet government in Aram-Damascus. The Arameans became subjects of David and were forced to bring tribute. God gave victory to David wherever he marched.
18.7 David plundered the gold shields that belonged to the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
18.8 He also looted Tebah and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, of a huge quantity of bronze that Solomon later used to make the Great Bronze Sea, the Pillars, and bronze equipment in The Temple.
18.9 Tou king of Hamath heard that David had struck down the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah.
18.10 He sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet and congratulate him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer. Tou and Hadadezer were old enemies. Hadoram brought David various things made of silver, gold, and bronze.
18.11 King David consecrated these things along with the silver and gold that he had plundered from other nations: Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.
18.12 Abishai son of Zeruiah fought and defeated the Edomites in the Valley of Salt - 18,000 of them.
18.13 He set up a puppet government in Edom and the Edomites became subjects under David.  God gave David victory wherever he marched.
18.14 Thus David ruled over all of Israel. He ruled well, fair and evenhanded in all his duties and relationships.
18.15 Joab son of Zeruiah was head of the army;  Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of public records;
18.16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Abimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was secretary;
18.17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the special forces, the Kerethites and Pelethites;  And David's sons held high positions, close to the king.
19.1 Some time after this Nahash king of the Ammonites died and his son succeeded him as king.
19.2 David said, "I'd like to show some kindness to Hanun son of Nahash - treat him as well and as kindly as his father treated me." So David sent condolences about his father's death.
19.3 the Ammonite leaders warned Hanun, "Do you for a minute suppose that David is honoring your father by sending you comforters? Don't you know that he's sent these men to snoop around the city and size it up so that he can capture it?"
19.4 So Hanun seized David's men, shaved them clean, cut off their robes half way up their buttocks, and sent them packing.
19.5 When this was all reported to David, he sent someone to meet them, for they were seriously humiliated. The king told them, "Stay in Jericho until your beards grow out; only then come back."
19.6 When it dawned on the Ammonites that as far as David was concerned, they stank to high heaven,
19.7 they hired, at a cost of a thousand talents of silver (thirty-seven and a half tons!), chariots and horsemen from the Arameans of Naharaim, Maacah, and Zobah - 32,000 chariots and drivers; plus the king of Maacah with his troops who came and set up camp at Medeba; the Ammonites, too, were mobilized from their cities and got ready for battle.
19.8 When David heard this, he dispatched Joab with his strongest fighters in full force.
19.9 The Ammonites marched out and spread out in battle formation at the city gate; the kings who had come as allies took up a position in the open fields.
19.10 When Joab saw that he had two fronts to fight, before and behind, he took his pick of the best of Israel and deployed them to confront the Arameans.
19.11 The rest of the army he put under the command of Abishai, his brother, and deployed them to deal with the Ammonites.
19.12 Then he said, "If the Arameans are too much for me, you help me; and if the Ammonites prove too much for you, I'll come and help you.
19.13 Courage! We'll fight might and main for our people and for the cities of our God. And God will do whatever he sees needs doing!"
19.14 But when Joab and his soldiers moved in to fight the Arameans, they ran off in full retreat.
19.15 Then the Ammonites, seeing the Arameans run for dear life, took to their heels and ran from Abishai into the city.  So Joab withdrew from the Ammonites and returned to Jerusalem.
19.16 When the Arameans saw how badly they'd been beaten by Israel, they picked up the pieces and regrouped; they sent for the Arameans who were across the river; Shophach, commander of Hadadezer's army, led them.
19.17 When all this was reported to David, he mustered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, advanced, and prepared to fight. The Arameans went into battle formation, ready for David, and the fight was on.
19.18 But the Arameans again scattered before Israel. David killed 7,000 chariot drivers and 40,000 infantry. He also killed Shophach, the army commander.
19.19 When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed by Israel, they made peace with David and served him. The Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites ever again.
20.1 That spring, the time when kings usually go off to war, Joab led the army out and ravaged the Ammonites. He then set siege to Rabbah. David meanwhile was back in Jerusalem. Joab hit Rabbah hard and left it in ruins.
20.2 David took the crown off the head of their king. Its weight was found to be a talent of gold and set with a precious stone. It was placed on David's head. He hauled great quantities of loot from the city
20.3 and put the people to hard labor with saws and picks and axes. This is what he did to all the Ammonites. Then David and his army returned to Jerusalem.
20.4 Later war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. That was the time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai of the clan of giants. The Philistines had to eat crow.
20.5 In another war with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite whose spear was like a ship's boom.
20.6 And then there was the war at Gath that featured a hulking giant who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and foot - yet another from the clan of giants.
20.7 When he mocked Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
20.8 These came from the clan of giants and were killed by David and his men.
21.1 Now Satan entered the scene and seduced David into taking a census of Israel.
21.2 David gave orders to Joab and the army officers under him, "Canvass all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and get a count of the population. I want to know the number."
21.3 Joab resisted: "May God multiply his people by hundreds! Don't they all belong to my master the king? But why on earth would you do a thing like this - why risk getting Israel into trouble with God?"
21.4 But David wouldn't take no for an answer, so Joab went off and did it - canvassed the country and then came back to Jerusalem
21.5 and reported the results of the census: There were 1,100,000 fighting men; of that total, Judah accounted for 470,000.
21.6 Joab, disgusted by the command - it, in fact, turned his stomach! - protested by leaving Levi and Benjamin out of the census-taking.
21.7 And God, offended by the whole thing, punished Israel.
21.8 Then David prayed, "I have sinned badly in what I have just done, substituting statistics for trust; forgive my sin - I've been really stupid."
21.9 God answered by speaking to Gad, David's pastor:
21.10 "Go and give David this message: 'God's word: You have your choice of three punishments; choose one and I'll do the rest.'"
21.11 Gad delivered the message to David:
21.12 "Do you want three years of famine, three months of running from your enemies while they chase you down, or three days of the sword of God - an epidemic unleashed on the country by an angel of God? Think it over and make up your mind. What shall I tell the One who sent me?"
21.13 David told Gad, "They're all terrible! But I'd rather be punished by God whose mercy is great, than fall into human hands."
21.14 So God unleashed an epidemic in Israel - 70,000 Israelites died.
21.15 God then sent the angel to Jerusalem but when he saw the destruction about to begin, he compassionately changed his mind and ordered the death angel, "Enough's enough! Pull back!"
21.16 David looked up and saw the angel hovering between earth and sky, sword drawn and about to strike Jerusalem. David and the elders bowed in prayer and covered themselves with rough burlap.
21.17 David prayed, "Please! I'm the one who sinned; I'm the one at fault. But these sheep, what did they do wrong? Punish me, not them, me and my family; don't take it out on them."
21.18 The angel of God ordered Gad to tell David to go and build an altar to God on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
21.19 David did what Gad told him in obedience to God's command.
21.20 Meanwhile Araunah had quit threshing the wheat and was watching the angel; his four sons took cover and hid.
21.21 David came up to Araunah. When Araunah saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed deeply before David, honoring the king.
21.22 David said to Araunah, "Give me the site of the threshing floor so I can build an altar to God. Charge me the market price; we're going to put an end to this disaster."
21.23 "O master, my king," said Araunah, "just take it; do whatever you want with it! Look, here's an ox for the burnt offering and threshing paddles for the fuel and wheat for the meal offering - it's all yours!"
21.24 David replied to Araunah, "No. I'm buying it from you, and at the full market price. I'm not going to offer God sacrifices that are no sacrifice."
21.25 So David bought the place from Araunah for 600 shekels of gold.
21.26 He built an altar to God there and sacrificed Whole-Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings. He called out to God and God answered by striking the altar of Whole-Burnt-Offering with lightning.
21.27 Then God told the angel to put his sword back into its scabbard.
21.28 And that's the story of what happened when David saw that God answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite at the time he offered the sacrifice.
21.29 At this time the Tabernacle that Moses had constructed in the desert, and with it the Altar of Burnt Offering, were set up at the worship center at Gibeon.
21.30 But David, terrified by the angel's sword, wouldn't go there to pray to God anymore.
22.1 So David declared, "From now on, this is the site for the worship of God; this is the place for Israel's Altar of Burnt Offering."
22.2 David ordered all the resident aliens in the land to come together; he sent them to the stone quarries to cut dressed stone to build The Temple of God.
22.3 He also stockpiled a huge quantity of iron for nails and bracings for the doors of the gates, more bronze than could be weighed,
22.4 and cedar logs past counting (the Sidonians and Tyrians shipped in huge loads of cedar logs for David).
22.5 David was thinking, "My son Solomon is too young to plan ahead for this. But the sanctuary that is to be built for God has to be the greatest, the talk of all the nations; so I'll get the construction materials together." That's why David prepared this huge stockpile of building materials before he died.
22.6 Then he called in Solomon his son and commanded him to build a sanctuary for the God of Israel.
22.7 David said to Solomon, "I wanted in the worst way to build a sanctuary to honor my God.
22.8 But God prevented me, saying, 'You've killed too many people, fought too many wars. You are not the one to honor me by building a sanctuary - you've been responsible for too much killing, too much bloodshed.
22.9 But you are going to have a son and he will be a quiet and peaceful man, and I will calm his enemies down on all sides. His very name will speak peace - that is, Solomon, which means Peace - and I'll give peace and rest under his rule.
22.10 He will be the one to build a sanctuary in my honor. He'll be my royal adopted son and I'll be his father; and I'll make sure that the authority of his kingdom over Israel lasts forever.'
22.11 "So now, son, God be with you. God-speed as you build the sanctuary for your God, the job God has given you.
22.12 And may God also give you discernment and understanding when he puts you in charge of Israel so that you will rule in reverent obedience under God's Revelation.
22.13 That's what will make you successful, following the directions and doing the things that God commanded Moses for Israel. Courage! Take charge! Don't be timid; don't hold back.
22.14 Look at this - I've gone to a lot of trouble to stockpile materials for the sanctuary of God: 100,000 talents (3,775 tons) of gold, a million talents (37,750 tons) of silver, tons of bronze and iron - too much to weigh - and all this timber and stone. And you're free to add more.
22.15 And workers both plentiful and prepared: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, artisans in
22.16 gold and silver, bronze and iron. You're all set - get to work! And God-speed!"
22.17 David gave orders to all of Israel's leaders to help his son Solomon,
22.18 saying, "Isn't it obvious that your God is present with you; that he has given you peaceful relations with everyone around? My part in this was to put down the enemies, subdue the land to God and his people;
22.19 your part is to give yourselves, heart and soul, to praying to your God. So get moving - build the sacred house of worship to God! Then bring the Chest of the Covenant of God and all the holy furnishings for the worship of God into the sanctuary built in honor of God."
23.1 When David got to be an old man, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
23.2 At the same time he brought together all the leaders of Israel, the priests, and the Levites.
23.3 The Levites thirty years and older were counted; the total was 38,000.
23.4 David sorted them into work groups: "24,000 are in charge of administering worship in the sanctuary; 6,000 are officials and judges
23.5 4,000 are security guards; and 4,000 are to serve in the orchestra, praising God with instruments that I have provided for praise."
23.6 David then divided the Levites into groupings named after the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
23.7 The Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
23.8 The three sons of Ladan: Jehiel, Zetham, and Joel.
23.9 The three sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, all heads of the families of Ladan.
23.10 The four sons of Shimei: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah.
23.11 Jahath came first, followed by Ziza. Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons so they were counted as one family with one task.
23.12 The four sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
23.13 The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was especially ordained to work in the Holy of Holies, to burn incense before God, to serve God and bless his Name always. This was a permanent appointment for Aaron and his sons.
23.14 Moses and his sons were counted in the tribe of Levi
23.15 The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.
23.16 Shubael was the first son of Gershom.
23.17 Rehabiah was the first and only son of Eliezer; but though Eliezer had no other sons, Rehabiah had many sons.
23.18 Shelomith was the first son of Izhar.
23.19 Hebron had four sons: Jeriah, Amariah, Jahaziel, and Jekameam
23.20 Uzziel had two sons: Micah and Isshiah.
23.21 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish
23.22 Eleazar died without any sons, only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married the daughters.
23.23 Mushi had three sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
23.24 These are the sons of Levi twenty years and older, divided up according to families and heads of families and listed in the work groups that took care of the worship in the sanctuary of God.
23.25 David said, "Now that the God of Israel has given rest to his people and made Jerusalem his permanent home,
23.26 the Levites no longer have to carry the Tabernacle and all the furniture required for the work of worship."
23.27 These last words of David referred only to Levites twenty years old and above.
23.28 From now on the assigned work of the Levites was to assist Aaron's sons in the work of worship in God's house: maintain courtyards and closets, keep the furniture and utensils of worship clean, take care of any extra work needed in the work of worship,
23.29 and provide bread for the table and flour for the Meal Offerings and the unraised wafers - all baking and mixing, all measuring and weighing.
23.30 Also they were to be present for morning prayers, thanking and praising God, for evening prayers,
23.31 and at the service of Whole-Burnt-Offerings to God on Sabbath, at New Moons, and at all festivals. They were on regular duty to serve God according to their assignment and the required number.
23.32 In short, the Levites, with the sons of Aaron as their companions in the ministry of holy worship, were responsible for everything that had to do with worship: the place and times and ordering of worship.
24.1 The family of Aaron was grouped as follows: Aaron's sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
24.2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father and left no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar filled the office of priest.
24.3 David assigned Zadok from the family of Eleazar and Ahimelech from the family of Ithamar and assigned them to separate divisions for carrying out their appointed ministries.
24.4 It turned out that there were more leaders in Eleazar's family than in Ithamar's and so they divided them proportionately: sixteen clan leaders from Eleazar's family and eight clan leaders from Ithamar's family.
24.5 They assigned the leaders by lot, treating both families alike, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among both the Eleazar and Ithamar families.
24.6 The secretary Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, wrote down their names in the presence of the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the priestly and Levitical families. They took turns: One family was selected from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.
24.7 The first lot fell to Jehoiarib,  the second to Jedaiah,
24.8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
24.9 the fifth to Malkijah,  the sixth to Mijamin,
24.10 the seventh to Hakkoz,  the eighth to Abijah,
24.11 the ninth to Jeshua,  the tenth to Shecaniah,
24.12 the eleventh to Eliashib,  the twelfth to Jakim,
24.13 the thirteenth to Huppah,  the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
24.14 the fifteenth to Bilgah,  the sixteenth to Immer,
24.15 the seventeenth to Hezir,  the eighteenth to Happizzez,
24.16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah,  the twentieth to Jehezkel,
24.17 the twenty-first to Jakin,  the twenty-second to Gamul,
24.18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
24.19 They served in this appointed order when they entered The Temple of God, following the procedures laid down by their ancestor Aaron as God, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
24.20 The rest of the Levites are as follows:  From the sons of Amram: Shubael; from the sons of Shubael: Jehdeiah.
24.21 Concerning Rehabiah: from his sons, Isshiah was the first.
24.22 From the Izharites: Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.
24.23 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
24.24 The son of Uzziel: Micah, and from the sons of Micah: Shamir.
24.25 The brother of Micah was Isshiah, and from the sons of Isshiah: Zechariah.
24.26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno.
24.27 The sons of Merari from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.
24.28 From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
24.29 From Kish: Jerahmeel, the son of Kish.
24.30 And from the sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
24.31 They also cast lots, the same as their kindred the sons of Aaron had done, in the presence of David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the leaders of the priestly and Levitical families. The families of the oldest and youngest brothers were treated the same.
25.1 Next David and the worship leaders selected some from the family of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun for special service in preaching and music. Here is the roster of names and assignments:
25.2 From the family of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah; they were supervised by Asaph, who spoke for God backed up by the king's authority.
25.3 From the family of Jeduthun there were six sons: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah; they were supervised by their father Jeduthun, who preached and accompanied himself with the zither - he was responsible for leading the thanks and praise to God.
25.4 From the family of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shubael, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth.
25.5 These were the sons of Heman the king's seer; they supported and assisted him in his divinely appointed work. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
25.6 Under their father's supervision they were in charge of leading the singing and providing musical accompaniment in the work of worship in the sanctuary of God (Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman took their orders directly from the king).
25.7 They were well-trained in the sacred music, all of them masters. There were 288 of them.
25.8 They drew names at random to see who would do what. Nobody, whether young or old, teacher or student, was given preference or advantage over another.
25.9 The first name from Asaph's family was Joseph and his twelve sons and brothers; second, Gedaliah and his twelve sons and brothers;
25.10 third, Zaccur and his twelve sons and brothers;

25.30 twenty-third, Mahazioth and his twelve sons and brothers;
25.31 twenty-fourth, Romamti-Ezer and his twelve sons and brothers.
26.1 The teams of security guards were from the family of Korah: Meshelemiah son of Kore (one of the sons of Asaph).
26.2 Meshelemiah's sons were Zechariah, the firstborn, followed by Jediael, Zebadiah, Jathniel,
26.3 Elam, Jehohanan, and Eliehoenai - seven sons.
26.4 Obed-Edom's sons were Shemaiah, the firstborn, followed by Jehozabad, Joah, Sacar, Nethanel,
26.5 Ammiel, Issachar, and Peullethai - God blessed him with eight sons.
26.6 His son Shemaiah had sons who provided outstanding leadership in the family:
26.7 Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad; his relatives Elihu and Semakiah were also exceptional.
26.8 These all came from the line of Obed-Edom - all of them outstanding and strong. There were sixty-two of them.
26.9 Meshelemiah had eighteen sons and relatives who were outstanding.
26.10 The sons of Hosah the Merarite were Shimri (he was not the firstborn but his father made him first),
26.11 then Hilkiah, followed by Tabaliah and Zechariah. Hosah accounted for thirteen.
26.12 These teams of security guards, supervised by their leaders, kept order in The Temple of God, keeping up the traditions of their ancestors.
26.13 They were all assigned to their posts by the same method regardless of the prominence of their families - each picked his gate assignment from a hat.
26.14 Shelemiah was assigned to the East Gate; his son Zechariah, a shrewd counselor, got the North Gate.
26.15 Obed-Edom got the South Gate; and his sons pulled duty at the storehouse.
26.16 Shuppim and Hosah were posted to the West Gate and the Shalleketh Gate on the high road.
26.17 six Levites per day on the east, four per day on the north and on the south, and two at a time at the storehouse.
26.18 At the open court to the west, four guards were posted on the road and two at the court.
26.19 These are the teams of security guards from the sons of Korah and Merari. Financial Affairs: Accountants and Bookkeepers
26.20 Other Levites were put in charge of the financial affairs of The Temple of God.
26.21 From the family of Ladan (all Gershonites) came Jehieli,
26.22 and the sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his brother Joel. They supervised the finances of the sanctuary of God.
26.23 From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites:
26.24 Shubael, descended from Gershom the son of Moses, was the chief financial officer.
26.25 His relatives through Eliezer: his son Rehabiah, his son Jeshaiah, his son Joram, his son Zicri, and his son Shelomith.
26.26 Shelomith and his relatives were in charge of valuables consecrated by David the king, family heads, and various generals and commanders from the army.
26.27 They dedicated the plunder that they had gotten in war to the work of the worship of God.
26.28 In addition, everything that had been dedicated by Samuel the seer, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah - anything that had been dedicated, ever, was the responsibility of Shelomith and his family.
26.29 From the family of the Izharites, Kenaniah and sons were appointed as officials and judges responsible for affairs outside the work of worship and sanctuary.
26.30 From the family of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his relatives - 1,700 well-qualified men - were responsible for administration of matters related to the worship of God and the king's work in the territory west of the Jordan.
26.31 According to the family tree of the Hebronites, Jeriah held pride of place. In the fortieth year of David's reign (his last), the Hebron family tree was researched and outstanding men were found at Jazer in Gilead,
26.32 namely, Jeriah and 2,700 men of his extended family: David the king made them responsible for administration of matters related to the worship of God and the work of the king in the territory east of the Jordan - the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
27.1 Here is the listing of the sons of Israel by family heads, commanders and captains, and other officers who served the king in everything military. Army divisions were on duty a month at a time for the twelve months of the year. Each division comprised 24,000 men.
27.2 First division, first month: Jashobeam son of Zabdiel was in charge with 24,000 men.
27.3 He came from the line of Perez. He was over all the army officers during the first month.

27.5 Commander for the third month: Benaiah son of Jehoiada the priest with 24,000 men.
27.6 This was the same Benaiah who was a Mighty Man among the Thirty and their chief. His son Ammizabad was in charge of the division.

27.22 for Dan: Azarel son of Jeroham. These are the administrative officers assigned to the tribes of Israel.
27.23 David didn't keep a count of men under the age of twenty, because God had promised to give Israel a population as numerous as the stars in the sky.
27.24 Joab son of Zeruiah started out counting the men, but he never finished. God's anger broke out on Israel because of the counting. As it turned out, the numbers were never entered into the court records of King David.
27.25 The king's storage facilities were supervised by Azmaveth son of Adiel. Jonathan son of Uzziah was responsible for the warehouses in the outlying areas.
27.26 Ezri son of Kelub was in charge of the field workers on the farms.
27.27 Shimei the Ramathite was in charge of the vineyards and Zabdi the Shiphmite was in charge of grapes for the wine vats.
27.28 Baal-Hanan the Gederite was in charge of the olive and sycamore-fig trees in the western hills, and Joash was in charge of the olive oil.
27.29 Shitrai the Sharonite was in charge of herds grazing in Sharon and Shaphat son of Adlai was in charge of herds in the valley.
27.30 Obil the Ismaelite was in charge of the camels, Jehdeiah the Meronothite was in charge of the donkeys,
27.31 and Jaziz the Hagrite was in charge of the flocks.  These were the ones responsible for taking care of King David's property.
27.32 Jonathan, David's uncle, a wise and literate counselor, and Jehiel son of Hacmoni, were responsible for rearing the king's sons.
27.33 Ahithophel was the king's counselor; Hushai the Arkite was the king's friend.
27.34 Ahithophel was later replaced by Jehoiada son of Benaiah and by Abiathar.  Joab was commander of the king's army.
28.1 David called together all the leaders of Israel - tribal administrators, heads of various governmental operations, military commanders and captains, stewards in charge of the property and livestock belonging to the king and his sons - everyone who held responsible positions in the kingdom.
28.2 King David stood tall and spoke: "Listen to me, my people: I fully intended to build a permanent structure for the Chest of the Covenant of God, God's footstool. But when I got ready to build it,
28.3 God said to me, 'You may not build a house to honor me - you've done too much fighting - killed too many people.'
28.4 God chose me out of my family to be king over Israel forever. First he chose Judah as the lead tribe, then he narrowed it down to my family, and finally he picked me from my father's sons, pleased to make me the king over all Israel.
28.5 And then from all my sons - and God gave me many! - he chose my son Solomon to sit on the throne of God's rule over Israel.
28.6 He went on to say, 'Your son Solomon will build my house and my courts: I have chosen him to be my royal adopted son; and I will be to him a father.
28.7 I will guarantee that his kingdom will last if he continues to be as strong-minded in doing what I command and carrying out my decisions as he is doing now.'
28.8 "And now, in this public place, all Israel looking on and God listening in, as God's people, obey and study every last one of the commandments of your God so that you can make the most of living in this good land and pass it on intact to your children, insuring a good future.
28.9 "And you, Solomon my son, get to know well your father's God; serve him with a whole heart and eager mind, for God examines every heart and sees through every motive. If you seek him, he'll make sure you find him, but if you abandon him, he'll leave you for good.
28.10 Look sharp now! God has chosen you to build his holy house. Be brave, determined! And do it!"
28.11 Then David presented his son Solomon with the plans for The Temple complex: porch, storerooms, meeting rooms, and the place for atoning sacrifice.
28.12 He turned over the plans for everything that God's Spirit had brought to his mind: the design of the courtyards, the arrangements of rooms, and the closets for storing all the holy things.
28.13 He gave him his plan for organizing the Levites and priests in their work of leading and ordering worship in the house of God, and for caring for the liturgical furnishings.
28.14 e provided exact specifications for how much gold and silver was needed for each article used in the serv- ices of worship:
28.15 the gold and silver Lampstands and lamps,
28.16 the gold tables for consecrated bread, the silver tables,
28.17 the gold forks, the bowls and the jars,
28.18 and the incense altar. And he gave him the plan for sculpting the cherubs with their wings outstretched over the Chest of the Covenant of God - the cherubim throne.
28.19 "Here are the blueprints for the whole project as God gave me to understand it," David said.
28.20 David continued to address Solomon: "Take charge! Take heart! Don't be anxious or get discouraged. God, my God, is with you in this; he won't walk off and leave you in the lurch. He's at your side until every last detail is completed for conducting the worship of God.
28.21 You have all the priests and Levites standing ready to pitch in, and skillful craftsmen and artisans of every kind ready to go to work. Both leaders and people are ready. Just say the word."
29.1 Then David the king addressed the congregation: "My son Solomon was singled out and chosen by God to do this. But he's young and untested and the work is huge - this is not just a place for people to meet each other, but a house for God to meet us.
29.2 I've done my best to get everything together for building this house for my God, all the materials necessary: gold, silver, bronze, iron, lumber, precious and varicolored stones, and building stones - vast stockpiles.
29.3 Furthermore, because my heart is in this, in addition to and beyond what I have gathered, I'm turning over my personal fortune of gold and silver for making this place of worship for my God:
29.4 3,000 talents (about 113 tons) of gold - all from Ophir, the best - and 7,000 talents (214 tons) of silver for covering the walls of the buildings,
29.5 and for the gold and silver work by craftsmen and artisans.  "And now, how about you? Who among you is ready and willing to join in the giving?"
29.6 Ready and willing, the heads of families, leaders of the tribes of Israel, commanders and captains in the army, stewards of the king's affairs, stepped forward and gave willingly.
29.7 They gave 5,000 talents (188 tons) and 10,000 darics (185 pounds) of gold, 10,000 talents of silver (377 tons), 18,000 talents of bronze (679 tons), and 100,000 talents (3,775 tons) of iron.
29.8 Anyone who had precious jewels put them in the treasury for the building of The Temple of God in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.
29.9 And the people were full of a sense of celebration - all that giving! And all given willingly, freely! King David was exuberant.
29.10 David blessed God in full view of the entire congregation: Blessed are you, God of Israel, our father from of old and forever.
29.11 To you, O God, belong the greatness and the might, the glory, the victory, the majesty, the splendor; Yes! Everything in heaven, everything on earth; the kingdom all yours! You've raised yourself high over all.
29.12 Riches and glory come from you, you're ruler over all; You hold strength and power in the palm of your hand to build up and strengthen all.
29.13 And here we are, O God, our God, giving thanks to you, praising your splendid Name.
29.14 "But me - who am I, and who are these my people, that we should presume to be giving something to you? Everything comes from you; all we're doing is giving back what we've been given from your generous hand.
29.15 As far as you're concerned, we're homeless, shiftless wanderers like our ancestors, our lives mere shadows, hardly anything to us.
29.16 God, our God, all these materials - these piles of stuff for building a house of worship for you, honoring your Holy Name - it all came from you! It was all yours in the first place!
29.17 I know, dear God, that you care nothing for the surface - you want us, our true selves - and so I have given from the heart, honestly and happily. And now see all these people doing the same, giving freely, willingly - what a joy!
29.18 O God, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, keep this generous spirit alive forever in these people always, keep their hearts set firmly in you.
29.19 And give my son Solomon an uncluttered and focused heart so that he can obey what you command, live by your directions and counsel, and carry through with building The Temple for which I have provided."
29.20 David then addressed the congregation: "Bless God, your God!" And they did it, blessed God, the God of their ancestors, and worshiped reverently in the presence of God and the king.
29.21 The very next day they butchered the sacrificial animals and offered in the worship of Israel to God a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand sheep, and in addition drink offerings and many other sacrifices.
29.22 They feasted all day, eating and drinking before God, exuberant with joy.
29.23 Solomon sat on the throne of God as king in place of David his father. And everything went well; all Israel obeyed him.
29.24 All the leaders of the people, including all the sons of King David, accepted Solomon as their king and promised their loyalty.
29.25 Solomon rode high on a crest of popular acclaim - it was all God's doing. God gave him position and honor beyond any king in Israel before him.
29.26 David son of Jesse ruled over all Israel.
29.27 He was king for forty years. He ruled from Hebron seven years and from Jerusalem thirty-three.
29.28 He died at a ripe old age, full of days, wealth, and glory. His son Solomon ruled after him.
29.29 The history of David the king, from start to finish, is written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the seer,
29.30 including a full account of his rule, his exploits, and the times through which he and Israel and the surrounding kingdoms passed.
