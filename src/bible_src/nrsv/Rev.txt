1.1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants what must soon take place; and he made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, 
1.2 who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. 
1.3 Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written therein; for the time is near. 
1.4 John to the seven churches that are in Asia:  Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,  
1.5 and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood  
1.6 and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
1.7 Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, every one who pierced him; and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen. 
1.8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.  
1.9 I John, your brother, who share with you in Jesus the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.  
1.10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet 
1.11 saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Per'gamum and to Thyati'ra and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to La-odice'a." 
1.12 Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands,  
1.13 and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden girdle round his breast; 
1.14 his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire, 
1.15 his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters; 
1.16 in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth issued a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength. 
1.17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand upon me, saying, "Fear not, I am the first and the last,  
1.18 and the living one; I died, and behold I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades. 
1.19 Now write what you see, what is and what is to take place hereafter. 
1.20 As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. 
2.1 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: `The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.  
2.2 "`I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear evil men but have tested those who call themselves apostles but are not, and found them to be false;  
2.3 I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary. 
2.4 But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. 
2.5 Remember then from what you have fallen, repent and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. 
2.6 Yet this you have, you hate the works of the Nicola'itans, which I also hate. 
2.7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.' 
2.8 "And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: `The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.  
2.9 "`I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.  
2.10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life. 
2.11 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who conquers shall not be hurt by the second death.' 
2.12 "And to the angel of the church in Per'gamum write: `The words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.  
2.13 "`I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; you hold fast my name and you did not deny my faith even in the days of An'tipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.  
2.14 But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality. 
2.15 So you also have some who hold the teaching of the Nicola'itans. 
2.16 Repent then. If not, I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth. 
2.17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one knows except him who receives it.' 
2.18 "And to the angel of the church in Thyati'ra write: `The words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze.  
2.19 "`I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.  
2.20 But I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jez'ebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. 
2.21 I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her immorality. 
2.22 Behold, I will throw her on a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her doings; 
2.23 and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you as your works deserve. 
2.24 But to the rest of you in Thyati'ra, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay upon you any other burden; 
2.25 only hold fast what you have, until I come. 
2.26 He who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, I will give him power over the nations, 
2.27 and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received power from my Father; 
2.28 and I will give him the morning star. 
2.29 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.' 
3.1 "And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: `The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars.  "`I know your works; you have the name of being alive, and you are dead.  
3.2 Awake, and strengthen what remains and is on the point of death, for I have not found your works perfect in the sight of my God. 
3.3 Remember then what you received and heard; keep that, and repent. If you will not awake, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you. 
3.4 Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy. 
3.5 He who conquers shall be clad thus in white garments, and I will not blot his name out of the book of life; I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels. 
3.6 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.' 
3.7 "And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: `The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and no one opens.  
3.8 "`I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut; I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.  
3.9 Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie -- behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and learn that I have loved you. 
3.10 Because you have kept my word of patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial which is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell upon the earth. 
3.11 I am coming soon; hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown. 
3.12 He who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God; never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name. 
3.13 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.' 
3.14 "And to the angel of the church in La-odice'a write: `The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation.  
3.15 "`I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot!  
3.16 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of my mouth. 
3.17 For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing; not knowing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. 
3.18 Therefore I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may be rich, and white garments to clothe you and to keep the shame of your nakedness from being seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see. 
3.19 Those whom I love, I reprove and chasten; so be zealous and repent. 
3.20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any one hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. 
3.21 He who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne. 
3.22 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'" 
4.1 After this I looked, and lo, in heaven an open door! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up hither, and I will show you what must take place after this."  
4.2 At once I was in the Spirit, and lo, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne! 
4.3 And he who sat there appeared like jasper and carnelian, and round the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald. 
4.4 Round the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clad in white garments, with golden crowns upon their heads. 
4.5 From the throne issue flashes of lightning, and voices and peals of thunder, and before the throne burn seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God; 
4.6 and before the throne there is as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. And round the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind:  
4.7 the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle. 
4.8 And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they never cease to sing, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!"
4.9 And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives for ever and ever, 
4.10 the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever; they cast their crowns before the throne, singing, 
4.11 "Worthy art thou, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou didst create all things, and by thy will they existed and were created." 
5.1 And I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals;  
5.2 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?" 
5.3 And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it, 
5.4 and I wept much that no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to into into it. 
5.5 Then one of the elders said to me, "Weep not; lo, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals." 
5.6 And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth;  
5.7 and he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. 
5.8 And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints; 
5.9 and they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy art thou to take the scroll and to open its seals, for thou wast slain and by thy blood didst ransom men for God from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,
5.10 and hast made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on earth."
5.11 Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, 
5.12 saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!" 
5.13 And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all therein, saying, "To him who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might for ever and ever!" 
5.14 And the four living creatures said, "Amen!" and the elders fell down and worshiped. 
6.1 Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say, as with a voice of thunder, "Come!"  
6.2 And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and its rider had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer. 
6.3 When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!"  
6.4 And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that men should slay one another; and he was given a great sword. 
6.5 When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and its rider had a balance in his hand;  
6.6 and I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm oil and wine!" 
6.7 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!"  
6.8 And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him; and they were given power over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth. 
6.9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne;  
6.10 they cried out with a loud voice, "O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before thou wilt judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the earth?" 
6.11 Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been. 
6.12 When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood,  
6.13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale; 
6.14 the sky vanished like a scroll that is rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place. 
6.15 Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong, and every one, slave and free, hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains, 
6.16 calling to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; 
6.17 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand before it?" 
7.1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree.  
7.2 Then I saw another angel ascend from the rising of the sun, with the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea, 
7.3 saying, "Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads." 
7.4 And I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed, out of every tribe of the sons of Israel, 
7.5 twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand of the tribe of Gad, 
7.6 twelve thousand of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand of the tribe of Naph'tali, twelve thousand of the tribe of Manas'seh, 
7.7 twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand of the tribe of Is'sachar, 
7.8 twelve thousand of the tribe of Zeb'ulun, twelve thousand of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand sealed out of the tribe of Benjamin. 
7.9 After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,  
7.10 and crying out with a loud voice, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb!" 
7.11 And all the angels stood round the throne and round the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
7.12 saying, "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God for ever and ever! Amen." 
7.13 Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, "Who are these, clothed in white robes, and whence have they come?"  
7.14 I said to him, "Sir, you know." And he said to me, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
7.15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night within his temple; and he who sits upon the throne will shelter them with his presence.
7.16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat.
7.17 For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of living water; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." 
8.1 When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.  
8.2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. 
8.3 And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; 
8.4 and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God. 
8.5 Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth; and there were peals of thunder, voices, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. 
8.6 Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made ready to blow them.  
8.7 The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, which fell on the earth; and a third of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.  
8.8 The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea;  
8.9 and a third of the sea became blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed. 
8.10 The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the fountains of water.  
8.11 The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many men died of the water, because it was made bitter. 
8.12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light was darkened; a third of the day was kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night.  
8.13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice, as it flew in midheaven, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets which the three angels are about to blow!"  
9.1 And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit;  
9.2 he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft. 
9.3 Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth; 
9.4 they were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree, but only those of mankind who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads; 
9.5 they were allowed to torture them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion, when it stings a man. 
9.6 And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death will fly from them. 
9.7 In appearance the locusts were like horses arrayed for battle; on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces,  
9.8 their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions' teeth; 
9.9 they had scales like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle. 
9.10 They have tails like scorpions, and stings, and their power of hurting men for five months lies in their tails. 
9.11 They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abad'don, and in Greek he is called Apol'lyon. 
9.12 The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come.  
9.13 Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,  
9.14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphra'tes." 
9.15 So the four angels were released, who had been held ready for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, to kill a third of mankind. 
9.16 The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand; I heard their number. 
9.17 And this was how I saw the horses in my vision: the riders wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulphur, and the heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire and smoke and sulphur issued from their mouths. 
9.18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed, by the fire and smoke and sulphur issuing from their mouths. 
9.19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; their tails are like serpents, with heads, and by means of them they wound. 
9.20 The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands nor give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot either see or hear or walk;  
9.21 nor did they repent of their murders or their sorceries or their immorality or their thefts. 
10.1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire.  
10.2 He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land, 
10.3 and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring; when he called out, the seven thunders sounded. 
10.4 And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down." 
10.5 And the angel whom I saw standing on sea and land lifted up his right hand to heaven 
10.6 and swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there should be no more delay, 
10.7 but that in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God, as he announced to his servants the prophets, should be fulfilled. 
10.8 Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go, take the scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."  
10.9 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll; and he said to me, "Take it and eat; it will be bitter to your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth." 
10.10 And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it; it was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter. 
10.11 And I was told, "You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." 
11.1 Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told: "Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there,  
11.2 but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample over the holy city for forty-two months. 
11.3 And I will grant my two witnesses power to prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth." 
11.4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.  
11.5 And if any one would harm them, fire pours out from their mouth and consumes their foes; if any one would harm them, thus he is doomed to be killed. 
11.6 They have power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they desire. 
11.7 And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war upon them and conquer them and kill them, 
11.8 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which is allegorically called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified. 
11.9 For three days and a half men from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb, 
11.10 and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth. 
11.11 But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. 
11.12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up hither!" And in the sight of their foes they went up to heaven in a cloud. 
11.13 And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. 
11.14 The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come.  
11.15 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever."  
11.16 And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God, 
11.17 saying, "We give thanks to thee, Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast, that thou hast taken thy great power and begun to reign.
11.18 The nations raged, but thy wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, for rewarding thy servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear thy name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth."
11.19 Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.  
12.1 And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;  
12.2 she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. 
12.3 And another portent appeared in heaven; behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads. 
12.4 His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth; 
12.5 she brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, 
12.6 and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which to be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days. 
12.7 Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought,  
12.8 but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. 
12.9 And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world -- he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. 
12.10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. 
12.11 And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. 
12.12 Rejoice then, O heaven and you that dwell therein! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!" 
12.13 And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had borne the male child.  
12.14 But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. 
12.15 The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood. 
12.16 But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon had poured from his mouth. 
12.17 Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus. And he stood on the sand of the sea. 
13.1 And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems upon its horns and a blasphemous name upon its heads.  
13.2 And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority. 
13.3 One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder. 
13.4 Men worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?" 
13.5 And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months;  
13.6 it opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. 
13.7 Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation, 
13.8 and all who dwell on earth will worship it, every one whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain. 
13.9 If any one has an ear, let him hear: 
13.10 If any one is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if any one slays with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints. 
13.11 Then I saw another beast which rose out of the earth; it had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.  
13.12 It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed. 
13.13 It works great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men; 
13.14 and by the signs which it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast, it deceives those who dwell on earth, bidding them make an image for the beast which was wounded by the sword and yet lived; 
13.15 and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should even speak, and to cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. 
13.16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, 
13.17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. 
13.18 This calls for wisdom: let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty-six. 
14.1 Then I looked, and lo, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.  
14.2 And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder; the voice I heard was like the sound of harpers playing on their harps, 
14.3 and they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth. 
14.4 It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are chaste; it is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes; these have been redeemed from mankind as first fruits for God and the Lamb, 
14.5 and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are spotless. 
14.6 Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;  
14.7 and he said with a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come; and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the fountains of water." 
14.8 Another angel, a second, followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of her impure passion."  
14.9 And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If any one worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,  
14.10 he also shall drink the wine of God's wrath, poured unmixed into the cup of his anger, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. 
14.11 And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name." 
14.12 Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.  
14.13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord henceforth." "Blessed indeed," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!"  
14.14 Then I looked, and lo, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.  
14.15 And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat upon the cloud, "Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe." 
14.16 So he who sat upon the cloud swung his sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. 
14.17 And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.  
14.18 Then another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Put in your sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe." 
14.19 So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God; 
14.20 and the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as a horse's bridle, for one thousand six hundred stadia. 
15.1 Then I saw another portent in heaven, great and wonderful, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is ended.  
15.2 And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands.  
15.3 And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and wonderful are thy deeds, O Lord God the Almighty! Just and true are thy ways, O King of the ages!
15.4 Who shall not fear and glorify thy name, O Lord? For thou alone art holy. All nations shall come and worship thee, for thy judgments have been revealed."
15.5 After this I looked, and the temple of the tent of witness in heaven was opened,  
15.6 and out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, robed in pure bright linen, and their breasts girded with golden girdles. 
15.7 And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives for ever and ever; 
15.8 and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended. 
16.1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God."  
16.2 So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth, and foul and evil sores came upon the men who bore the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.  
16.3 The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a dead man, and every living thing died that was in the sea.  
16.4 The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the fountains of water, and they became blood.  
16.5 And I heard the angel of water say, "Just art thou in these thy judgments, thou who art and wast, O Holy One.
16.6 For men have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink. It is their due!"
16.7 And I heard the altar cry, "Yea, Lord God the Almighty, true and just are thy judgments!"
16.8 The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch men with fire;  
16.9 men were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him glory. 
16.10 The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was in darkness; men gnawed their tongues in anguish  
16.11 and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores, and did not repent of their deeds. 
16.12 The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great river Euphra'tes, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east.  
16.13 And I saw, issuing from the mouth of the dragon and from the mouth of the beast and from the mouth of the false prophet, three foul spirits like frogs; 
16.14 for they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty. 
16.15 ("Lo, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is he who is awake, keeping his garments that he may not go naked and be seen exposed!") 
16.16 And they assembled them at the place which is called in Hebrew Armaged'don. 
16.17 The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"  
16.18 And there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as had never been since men were on the earth, so great was that earthquake. 
16.19 The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered great Babylon, to make her drain the cup of the fury of his wrath. 
16.20 And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found; 
16.21 and great hailstones, heavy as a hundred-weight, dropped on men from heaven, till men cursed God for the plague of the hail, so fearful was that plague. 
17.1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who is seated upon many waters,  
17.2 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and with the wine of whose fornication the dwellers on earth have become drunk." 
17.3 And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns. 
17.4 The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and bedecked with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her fornication; 
17.5 and on her forehead was written a name of mystery: "Babylon the great, mother of harlots and of earth's abominations." 
17.6 And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her I marveled greatly.  
17.7 But the angel said to me, "Why marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her. 
17.8 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to perdition; and the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will marvel to behold the beast, because it was and is not and is to come. 
17.9 This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; 
17.10 they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain only a little while. 
17.11 As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to perdition. 
17.12 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. 
17.13 These are of one mind and give over their power and authority to the beast; 
17.14 they will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful." 
17.15 And he said to me, "The waters that you saw, where the harlot is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.  
17.16 And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire, 
17.17 for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. 
17.18 And the woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion over the kings of the earth." 
18.1 After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority; and the earth was made bright with his splendor.  
18.2 And he called out with a mighty voice, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! It has become a dwelling place of demons, a haunt of every foul spirit, a haunt of every foul and hateful bird;
18.3 for all nations have drunk the wine of her impure passion, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich with the wealth of her wantonness."
18.4 Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,  "Come out of her, my people, lest you take part in her sins, lest you share in her plagues;
18.5 for her sins are heaped high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
18.6 Render to her as she herself has rendered, and repay her double for her deeds; mix a double draught for her in the cup she mixed.
18.7 As she glorified herself and played the wanton, so give her a like measure of torment and mourning. Since in her heart she says, `A queen I sit, I am no widow, mourning I shall never see,'
18.8 so shall her plagues come in a single day, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she shall be burned with fire; for mighty is the Lord God who judges her."
18.9 And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and were wanton with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning;  
18.10 they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, "Alas! alas! thou great city, thou mighty city, Babylon! In one hour has thy judgment come."
18.11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo any more,  
18.12 cargo of gold, silver, jewels and pearls, fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet, all kinds of scented wood, all articles of ivory, all articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble, 
18.13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls. 
18.14 "The fruit for which thy soul longed has gone from thee, and all thy dainties and thy splendor are lost to thee, never to be found again!"
18.15 The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud,  
18.16 "Alas, alas, for the great city that was clothed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet, bedecked with gold, with jewels, and with pearls!
18.17 In one hour all this wealth has been laid waste." And all shipmasters and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off  
18.18 and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, "What city was like the great city?"
18.19 And they threw dust on their heads, as they wept and mourned, crying out, "Alas, alas, for the great city where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth! In one hour she has been laid waste.
18.20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, O saints and apostles and prophets, for God has given judgment for you against her!"
18.21 Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,  "So shall Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence, and shall be found no more;
18.22 and the sound of harpers and minstrels, of flute players and trumpeters, shall be heard in thee no more; and a craftsman of any craft shall be found in thee no more; and the sound of the millstone shall be heard in thee no more;
18.23 and the light of a lamp shall shine in thee no more; and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard in thee no more; for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, and all nations were deceived by thy sorcery.
18.24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on earth." 
19.1 After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying,  "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
19.2 for his judgments are true and just; he has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants."
19.3 Once more they cried, "Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever."
19.4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who is seated on the throne, saying, "Amen. Hallelujah!" 
19.5 And from the throne came a voice crying, "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great."
19.6 Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunderpeals, crying, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.
19.7 Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready;
19.8 it was granted her to be clothed with fine linen, bright and pure" -- for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. 
19.9 And the angel said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he said to me, "These are true words of God."  
19.10 Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, "You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God." For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. 
19.11 Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! He who sat upon it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.  
19.12 His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has a name inscribed which no one knows but himself. 
19.13 He is clad in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. 
19.14 And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, followed him on white horses. 
19.15 From his mouth issues a sharp sword with which to smite the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron; he will tread the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. 
19.16 On his robe and on his thigh he has a name inscribed, King of kings and Lord of lords. 
19.17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly in midheaven, "Come, gather for the great supper of God,  
19.18 to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great." 
19.19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who sits upon the horse and against his army. 
19.20 And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had worked the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur. 
19.21 And the rest were slain by the sword of him who sits upon the horse, the sword that issues from his mouth; and all the birds were gorged with their flesh. 
20.1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain.  
20.2 And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, 
20.3 and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years were ended. After that he must be loosed for a little while. 
20.4 Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom judgment was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.  
20.5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection. 
20.6 Blessed and holy is he who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and they shall reign with him a thousand years. 
20.7 And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed from his prison  
20.8 and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, that is, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea. 
20.9 And they marched up over the broad earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city; but fire came down from heaven and consumed them, 
20.10 and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever. 
20.11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it; from his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them.  
20.12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they had done. 
20.13 And the sea gave up the dead in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and all were judged by what they had done. 
20.14 Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire; 
20.15 and if any one's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. 
21.1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.  
21.2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband; 
21.3 and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling of God is with men. He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them; 
21.4 he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away." 
21.5 And he who sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." Also he said, "Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true."  
21.6 And he said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the fountain of the water of life without payment. 
21.7 He who conquers shall have this heritage, and I will be his God and he shall be my son. 
21.8 But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted, as for murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death." 
21.9 Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me, saying, "Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb."  
21.10 And in the Spirit he carried me away to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, 
21.11 having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 
21.12 It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed; 
21.13 on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. 
21.14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
21.15 And he who talked to me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.  
21.16 The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its breadth; and he measured the city with his rod, twelve thousand stadia; its length and breadth and height are equal. 
21.17 He also measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits by a man's measure, that is, an angel's. 
21.18 The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass. 
21.19 The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every jewel; the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
21.20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. 
21.21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass. 
21.22 And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.  
21.23 And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb. 
21.24 By its light shall the nations walk; and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory into it, 
21.25 and its gates shall never be shut by day -- and there shall be no night there; 
21.26 they shall bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. 
21.27 But nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life. 
22.1 Then he showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb  
22.2 through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 
22.3 There shall no more be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall worship him; 
22.4 they shall see his face, and his name shall be on their foreheads. 
22.5 And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign for ever and ever. 
22.6 And he said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place.  
22.7 And behold, I am coming soon." Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.  
22.8 I John am he who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me;  
22.9 but he said to me, "You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God." 
22.10 And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.  
22.11 Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy." 
22.12 "Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense, to repay every one for what he has done.  
22.13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end." 
22.14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates.  
22.15 Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and every one who loves and practices falsehood. 
22.16 "I Jesus have sent my angel to you with this testimony for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star."  
22.17 The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come." And let him who hears say, "Come." And let him who is thirsty come, let him who desires take the water of life without price.  
22.18 I warn every one who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if any one adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book,  
22.19 and if any one takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book. 
22.20 He who testifies to these things says, "Surely I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!  
22.21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
