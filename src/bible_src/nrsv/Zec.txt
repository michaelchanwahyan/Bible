1.1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechari'ah the son of Berechi'ah, son of Iddo, the prophet, saying, 
1.2 "The LORD was very angry with your fathers. 
1.3 Therefore say to them, Thus says the LORD of hosts: Return to me, says the LORD of hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of hosts. 
1.4 Be not like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, `Thus says the LORD of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.' But they did not hear or heed me, says the LORD. 
1.5 Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live for ever? 
1.6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, As the LORD of hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so has he dealt with us." 
1.7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechari'ah the son of Berechi'ah, son of Iddo, the prophet; and Zechari'ah said,
1.8 "I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen; and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses. 
1.9 Then I said, `What are these, my lord?' The angel who talked with me said to me, `I will show you what they are.' 
1.10 So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, `These are they whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.' 
1.11 And they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees, `We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest.' 
1.12 Then the angel of the LORD said, `O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years?' 
1.13 And the LORD answered gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me. 
1.14 So the angel who talked with me said to me, `Cry out, Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion. 
1.15 And I am very angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was angry but a little they furthered the disaster. 
1.16 Therefore, thus says the LORD, I have returned to Jerusalem with compassion; my house shall be built in it, says the LORD of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem. 
1.17 Cry again, Thus says the LORD of hosts: My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.'" 
1.18 And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four horns!
1.19 And I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these?" And he answered me, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem." 
1.20 Then the LORD showed me four smiths. 
1.21 And I said, "What are these coming to do?" He answered, "These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man raised his head; and these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it." 
2.1 And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand!
2.2 Then I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length." 
2.3 And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him, 
2.4 and said to him, "Run, say to that young man, `Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and cattle in it. 
2.5 For I will be to her a wall of fire round about, says the LORD, and I will be the glory within her.'" 
2.6 Ho! ho! Flee from the land of the north, says the LORD; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, says the LORD.
2.7 Ho! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon. 
2.8 For thus said the LORD of hosts, after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you, for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye: 
2.9 "Behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me. 
2.10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for lo, I come and I will dwell in the midst of you, says the LORD. 
2.11 And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
2.12 And the LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem." 
2.13 Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.
3.1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.
3.2 And the LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, O Satan! The LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this a brand plucked from the fire?" 
3.3 Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy garments. 
3.4 And the angel said to those who were standing before him, "Remove the filthy garments from him." And to him he said, "Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you, and I will clothe you with rich apparel." 
3.5 And I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments; and the angel of the LORD was standing by. 
3.6 And the angel of the LORD enjoined Joshua,
3.7 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, then you shall rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among those who are standing here. 
3.8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men of good omen: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch. 
3.9 For behold, upon the stone which I have set before Joshua, upon a single stone with seven facets, I will engrave its inscription, says the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the guilt of this land in a single day. 
3.10 In that day, says the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor under his vine and under his fig tree." 
4.1 And the angel who talked with me came again, and waked me, like a man that is wakened out of his sleep.
4.2 And he said to me, "What do you see?" I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps which are on the top of it. 
4.3 And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left." 
4.4 And I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?" 
4.5 Then the angel who talked with me answered me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my lord." 
4.6 Then he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerub'babel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts. 
4.7 What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerub'babel you shall become a plain; and he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of `Grace, grace to it!'" 
4.8 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
4.9 "The hands of Zerub'babel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 
4.10 For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerub'babel. "These seven are the eyes of the LORD, which range through the whole earth."
4.11 Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?" 
4.12 And a second time I said to him, "What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the oil is poured out?" 
4.13 He said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" I said, "No, my lord." 
4.14 Then he said, "These are the two anointed who stand by the Lord of the whole earth." 
5.1 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying scroll!
5.2 And he said to me, "What do you see?" I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits." 
5.3 Then he said to me, "This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land; for every one who steals shall be cut off henceforth according to it, and every one who swears falsely shall be cut off henceforth according to it. 
5.4 I will send it forth, says the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it shall abide in his house and consume it, both timber and stones." 
5.5 Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, "Lift your eyes, and see what this is that goes forth."
5.6 And I said, "What is it?" He said, "This is the ephah that goes forth." And he said, "This is their iniquity in all the land." 
5.7 And behold, the leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting in the ephah! 
5.8 And he said, "This is Wickedness." And he thrust her back into the ephah, and thrust down the leaden weight upon its mouth. 
5.9 Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, two women coming forward! The wind was in their wings; they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between earth and heaven. 
5.10 Then I said to the angel who talked with me, "Where are they taking the ephah?" 
5.11 He said to me, "To the land of Shinar, to build a house for it; and when this is prepared, they will set the ephah down there on its base." 
6.1 And again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.
6.2 The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, 
6.3 the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled gray horses. 
6.4 Then I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, my lord?" 
6.5 And the angel answered me, "These are going forth to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the LORD of all the earth. 
6.6 The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go toward the west country, and the dappled ones go toward the south country." 
6.7 When the steeds came out, they were impatient to get off and patrol the earth. And he said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth. 
6.8 Then he cried to me, "Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country." 
6.9 And the word of the LORD came to me:
6.10 "Take from the exiles Heldai, Tobi'jah, and Jedai'ah, who have arrived from Babylon; and go the same day to the house of Josi'ah, the son of Zephani'ah. 
6.11 Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it upon the head of Joshua, the son of Jehoz'adak, the high priest; 
6.12 and say to him, `Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: for he shall grow up in his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD. 
6.13 It is he who shall build the temple of the LORD, and shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule upon his throne. And there shall be a priest by his throne, and peaceful understanding shall be between them both."' 
6.14 And the crown shall be in the temple of the LORD as a reminder to Heldai, Tobi'jah, Jedai'ah, and Josi'ah the son of Zephani'ah. 
6.15 "And those who are far off shall come and help to build the temple of the LORD; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God."
7.1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechari'ah in the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.
7.2 Now the people of Bethel had sent Share'zer and Reg'em-mel'ech and their men, to entreat the favor of the LORD, 
7.3 and to ask the priests of the house of the LORD of hosts and the prophets, "Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?" 
7.4 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me; 
7.5 "Say to all the people of the land and the priests, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted? 
7.6 And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves? 
7.7 When Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, with her cities round about her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited, were not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets?" 
7.8 And the word of the LORD came to Zechari'ah, saying,
7.9 "Thus says the LORD of hosts, Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy each to his brother, 
7.10 do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart." 
7.11 But they refused to hearken, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears that they might not hear. 
7.12 They made their hearts like adamant lest they should hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. 
7.13 "As I called, and they would not hear, so they called, and I would not hear," says the LORD of hosts, 
7.14 "and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and the pleasant land was made desolate." 
8.1 And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
8.2 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath. 
8.3 Thus says the LORD: I will return to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain. 
8.4 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand for very age. 
8.5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets. 
8.6 Thus says the LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, says the LORD of hosts? 
8.7 Thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country; 
8.8 and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness." 
8.9 Thus says the LORD of hosts: "Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets, since the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
8.10 For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in; for I set every man against his fellow. 
8.11 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, says the LORD of hosts. 
8.12 For there shall be a sowing of peace; the vine shall yield its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. 
8.13 And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong." 
8.14 For thus says the LORD of hosts: "As I purposed to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the LORD of hosts,
8.15 so again have I purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not. 
8.16 These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another, render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace, 
8.17 do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, says the LORD." 
8.18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
8.19 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace. 
8.20 "Thus says the LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities;
8.21 the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, `Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I am going.' 
8.22 Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of the LORD. 
8.23 Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, `Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.'" 
9.1 An Oracle The word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach and will rest upon Damascus. For to the LORD belong the cities of Aram, even as all the tribes of Israel;
9.2 Hamath also, which borders thereon, Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.
9.3 Tyre has built herself a rampart, and heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.
9.4 But lo, the Lord will strip her of her possessions and hurl her wealth into the sea, and she shall be devoured by fire.
9.5 Ash'kelon shall see it, and be afraid; Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; Ekron also, because its hopes are confounded. The king shall perish from Gaza; Ash'kelon shall be uninhabited;
9.6 a mongrel people shall dwell in Ashdod; and I will make an end of the pride of Philistia.
9.7 I will take away its blood from its mouth, and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah, and Ekron shall be like the Jeb'usites.
9.8 Then I will encamp at my house as a guard, so that none shall march to and fro; no oppressor shall again overrun them, for now I see with my own eyes.
9.9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Lo, your king comes to you; triumphant and victorious is he, humble and riding on an ass, on a colt the foal of an ass.
9.10 I will cut off the chariot from E'phraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall command peace to the nations; his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth.
9.11 As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your captives free from the waterless pit.
9.12 Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double.
9.13 For I have bent Judah as my bow; I have made E'phraim its arrow. I will brandish your sons, O Zion, over your sons, O Greece, and wield you like a warrior's sword.
9.14 Then the LORD will appear over them, and his arrow go forth like lightning; the Lord GOD will sound the trumpet, and march forth in the whirlwinds of the south.
9.15 The LORD of hosts will protect them, and they shall devour and tread down the slingers; and they shall drink their blood like wine, and be full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar.
9.16 On that day the LORD their God will save them for they are the flock of his people; for like the jewels of a crown they shall shine on his land.
9.17 Yea, how good and how fair it shall be! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maidens.
10.1 Ask rain from the LORD in the season of the spring rain, from the LORD who makes the storm clouds, who gives men showers of rain, to every one the vegetation in the field.
10.2 For the teraphim utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; the dreamers tell false dreams, and give empty consolation. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they are afflicted for want of a shepherd.
10.3 "My anger is hot against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the LORD of hosts cares for his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them like his proud steed in battle.
10.4 Out of them shall come the cornerstone, out of them the tent peg, out of them the battle bow, out of them every ruler.
10.5 Together they shall be like mighty men in battle, trampling the foe in the mud of the streets; they shall fight because the LORD is with them, and they shall confound the riders on horses.
10.6 "I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back because I have compassion on them, and they shall be as though I had not rejected them; for I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.
10.7 Then E'phraim shall become like a mighty warrior, and their hearts shall be glad as with wine. Their children shall see it and rejoice, their hearts shall exult in the LORD.
10.8 "I will signal for them and gather them in, for I have redeemed them, and they shall be as many as of old.
10.9 Though I scattered them among the nations, yet in far countries they shall remember me, and with their children they shall live and return.
10.10 I will bring them home from the land of Egypt, and gather them from Assyria; and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon, till there is no room for them.
10.11 They shall pass through the sea of Egypt, and the waves of the sea shall be smitten, and all the depths of the Nile dried up. The pride of Assyria shall be laid low, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.
10.12 I will make them strong in the LORD and they shall glory in his name," says the LORD.
11.1 Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars!
11.2 Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, for the glorious trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the thick forest has been felled!
11.3 Hark, the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is despoiled! Hark, the roar of the lions, for the jungle of the Jordan is laid waste!
11.4 Thus said the LORD my God: "Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter.
11.5 Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished; and those who sell them say, `Blessed be the LORD, I have become rich'; and their own shepherds have no pity on them. 
11.6 For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, says the LORD. Lo, I will cause men to fall each into the hand of his shepherd, and each into the hand of his king; and they shall crush the earth, and I will deliver none from their hand." 
11.7 So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slain for those who trafficked in the sheep. And I took two staffs; one I named Grace, the other I named Union. And I tended the sheep.
11.8 In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. 
11.9 So I said, "I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die; what is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed; and let those that are left devour the flesh of one another." 
11.10 And I took my staff Grace, and I broke it, annulling the covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 
11.11 So it was annulled on that day, and the traffickers in the sheep, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD. 
11.12 Then I said to them, "If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." And they weighed out as my wages thirty shekels of silver. 
11.13 Then the LORD said to me, "Cast it into the treasury" -- the lordly price at which I was paid off by them. So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of the LORD. 
11.14 Then I broke my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 
11.15 Then the LORD said to me, "Take once more the implements of a worthless shepherd.
11.16 For lo, I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for the perishing, or seek the wandering, or heal the maimed, or nourish the sound, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs. 
11.17 Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword smite his arm and his right eye! Let his arm be wholly withered, his right eye utterly blinded!"
12.1 An Oracle The word of the LORD concerning Israel: Thus says the LORD, who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth and formed the spirit of man within him:
12.2 "Lo, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of reeling to all the peoples round about; it will be against Judah also in the siege against Jerusalem. 
12.3 On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it shall grievously hurt themselves. And all the nations of the earth will come together against it. 
12.4 On that day, says the LORD, I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. But upon the house of Judah I will open my eyes, when I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. 
12.5 Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, `The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the LORD of hosts, their God.' 
12.6 "On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a blazing pot in the midst of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves; and they shall devour to the right and to the left all the peoples round about, while Jerusalem shall still be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem.
12.7 "And the LORD will give victory to the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not be exalted over that of Judah.
12.8 On that day the LORD will put a shield about the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the angel of the LORD, at their head. 
12.9 And on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
12.10 "And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of compassion and supplication, so that, when they look on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a first-born.
12.11 On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadadrim'mon in the plain of Megid'do. 
12.12 The land shall mourn, each family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; 
12.13 the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shim'e-ites by itself, and their wives by themselves; 
12.14 and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves. 
13.1 "On that day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness.
13.2 "And on that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, so that they shall be remembered no more; and also I will remove from the land the prophets and the unclean spirit.
13.3 And if any one again appears as a prophet, his father and mother who bore him will say to him, `You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the LORD'; and his father and mother who bore him shall pierce him through when he prophesies. 
13.4 On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; he will not put on a hairy mantle in order to deceive, 
13.5 but he will say, `I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the soil; for the land has been my possession since my youth.' 
13.6 And if one asks him, `What are these wounds on your back?' he will say, `The wounds I received in the house of my friends.'" 
13.7 "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who stands next to me," says the LORD of hosts. "Strike the shepherd, that the sheep may be scattered; I will turn my hand against the little ones.
13.8 In the whole land, says the LORD, two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive.
13.9 And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, `They are my people'; and they will say, `The LORD is my God.'"
14.1 Behold, a day of the LORD is coming, when the spoil taken from you will be divided in the midst of you.
14.2 For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women ravished; half of the city shall go into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city. 
14.3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle. 
14.4 On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives which lies before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley; so that one half of the Mount shall withdraw northward, and the other half southward. 
14.5 And the valley of my mountains shall be stopped up, for the valley of the mountains shall touch the side of it; and you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzzi'ah king of Judah. Then the LORD your God will come, and all the holy ones with him. 
14.6 On that day there shall be neither cold nor frost.
14.7 And there shall be continuous day (it is known to the LORD), not day and not night, for at evening time there shall be light. 
14.8 On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea; it shall continue in summer as in winter.
14.9 And the LORD will become king over all the earth; on that day the LORD will be one and his name one.
14.10 The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft upon its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Han'anel to the king's wine presses.
14.11 And it shall be inhabited, for there shall be no more curse; Jerusalem shall dwell in security. 
14.12 And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem: their flesh shall rot while they are still on their feet, their eyes shall rot in their sockets, and their tongues shall rot in their mouths.
14.13 And on that day a great panic from the LORD shall fall on them, so that each will lay hold on the hand of his fellow, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other; 
14.14 even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the nations round about shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance. 
14.15 And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the asses, and whatever beasts may be in those camps. 
14.16 Then every one that survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of booths.
14.17 And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain upon them. 
14.18 And if the family of Egypt do not go up and present themselves, then upon them shall come the plague with which the LORD afflicts the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of booths.
14.19 This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of booths. 
14.20 And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "Holy to the LORD." And the pots in the house of the LORD shall be as the bowls before the altar;
14.21 and every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be sacred to the LORD of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil the flesh of the sacrifice in them. And there shall no longer be a trader in the house of the LORD of hosts on that day.
