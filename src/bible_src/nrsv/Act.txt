1.1 In the first book, O The-oph'ilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, 
1.2 until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. 
1.3 To them he presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days, and speaking of the kingdom of God. 
1.4 And while staying with them he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, "you heard from me, 
1.5 for John baptized with water, but before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit." 
1.6 So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
1.7 He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. 
1.8 But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Sama'ria and to the end of the earth." 
1.9 And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. 
1.10 And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, 
1.11 and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven." 
1.12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath day's journey away;
1.13 and when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. 
1.14 All these with one accord devoted themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. 
1.15 In those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said,
1.16 "Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus. 
1.17 For he was numbered among us, and was allotted his share in this ministry. 
1.18 (Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. 
1.19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akel'dama, that is, Field of Blood.) 
1.20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, `Let his habitation become desolate, and let there be no one to live in it'; and `His office let another take.'
1.21 So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
1.22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us -- one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection." 
1.23 And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsab'bas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthi'as. 
1.24 And they prayed and said, "Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show which one of these two thou hast chosen 
1.25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place." 
1.26 And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthi'as; and he was enrolled with the eleven apostles. 
2.1 When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.
2.2 And suddenly a sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. 
2.3 And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and resting on each one of them. 
2.4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. 
2.5 Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.
2.6 And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. 
2.7 And they were amazed and wondered, saying, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? 
2.8 And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? 
2.9 Par'thians and Medes and E'lamites and residents of Mesopota'mia, Judea and Cappado'cia, Pontus and Asia, 
2.10 Phryg'ia and Pamphyl'ia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyre'ne, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, 
2.11 Cretans and Arabians, we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God." 
2.12 And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" 
2.13 But others mocking said, "They are filled with new wine." 
2.14 But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.
2.15 For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day; 
2.16 but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: 
2.17 `And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;
2.18 yea, and on my menservants and my maidservants in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.
2.19 And I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;
2.20 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and manifest day.
2.21 And it shall be that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'
2.22 "Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know --
2.23 this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. 
2.24 But God raised him up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. 
2.25 For David says concerning him, `I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;
2.26 therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh will dwell in hope.
2.27 For thou wilt not abandon my soul to Hades, nor let thy Holy One see corruption.
2.28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of gladness with thy presence.'
2.29 "Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
2.30 Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants upon his throne, 
2.31 he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. 
2.32 This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. 
2.33 Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear. 
2.34 For David did not ascend into the heavens; but he himself says, `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
2.35 till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet.'
2.36 Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified." 
2.37 Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?"
2.38 And Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
2.39 For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, every one whom the Lord our God calls to him." 
2.40 And he testified with many other words and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation." 
2.41 So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. 
2.42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 
2.43 And fear came upon every soul; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.
2.44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common; 
2.45 and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as any had need. 
2.46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they partook of food with glad and generous hearts, 
2.47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved. 
3.1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
3.2 And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at that gate of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms of those who entered the temple. 
3.3 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms. 
3.4 And Peter directed his gaze at him, with John, and said, "Look at us." 
3.5 And he fixed his attention upon them, expecting to receive something from them. 
3.6 But Peter said, "I have no silver and gold, but I give you what I have; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk." 
3.7 And he took him by the right hand and raised him up; and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. 
3.8 And leaping up he stood and walked and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. 
3.9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God, 
3.10 and recognized him as the one who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. 
3.11 While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's, astounded.
3.12 And when Peter saw it he addressed the people, "Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had made him walk? 
3.13 The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. 
3.14 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, 
3.15 and killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. 
3.16 And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you see and know; and the faith which is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all. 
3.17 "And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
3.18 But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. 
3.19 Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, 
3.20 and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, 
3.21 whom heaven must receive until the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old. 
3.22 Moses said, `The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren as he raised me up. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. 
3.23 And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.' 
3.24 And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came afterwards, also proclaimed these days. 
3.25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God gave to your fathers, saying to Abraham, `And in your posterity shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' 
3.26 God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness." 
4.1 And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sad'ducees came upon them,
4.2 annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
4.3 And they arrested them and put them in custody until the morrow, for it was already evening. 
4.4 But many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to about five thousand. 
4.5 On the morrow their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem,
4.6 with Annas the high priest and Ca'iaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. 
4.7 And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, "By what power or by what name did you do this?" 
4.8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders, 
4.9 if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a cripple, by what means this man has been healed, 
4.10 be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by him this man is standing before you well. 
4.11 This is the stone which was rejected by you builders, but which has become the head of the corner. 
4.12 And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." 
4.13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they wondered; and they recognized that they had been with Jesus.
4.14 But seeing the man that had been healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. 
4.15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred with one another, 
4.16 saying, "What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. 
4.17 But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to any one in this name." 
4.18 So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. 
4.19 But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge; 
4.20 for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard." 
4.21 And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for all men praised God for what had happened. 
4.22 For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old. 
4.23 When they were released they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
4.24 And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, 
4.25 who by the mouth of our father David, thy servant, didst say by the Holy Spirit, `Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?
4.26 The kings of the earth set themselves in array, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed' --
4.27 for truly in this city there were gathered together against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, 
4.28 to do whatever thy hand and thy plan had predestined to take place. 
4.29 And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness, 
4.30 while thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of thy holy servant Jesus." 
4.31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness. 
4.32 Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common.
4.33 And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. 
4.34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold 
4.35 and laid it at the apostles' feet; and distribution was made to each as any had need. 
4.36 Thus Joseph who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, 
4.37 sold a field which belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet. 
5.1 But a man named Anani'as with his wife Sapphi'ra sold a piece of property,
5.2 and with his wife's knowledge he kept back some of the proceeds, and brought only a part and laid it at the apostles' feet. 
5.3 But Peter said, "Anani'as, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the proceeds of the land? 
5.4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God." 
5.5 When Anani'as heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came upon all who heard of it. 
5.6 The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him. 
5.7 After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
5.8 And Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much." And she said, "Yes, for so much." 
5.9 But Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Hark, the feet of those that have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out." 
5.10 Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
5.11 And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard of these things. 
5.12 Now many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
5.13 None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high honor. 
5.14 And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women, 
5.15 so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. 
5.16 The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed. 
5.17 But the high priest rose up and all who were with him, that is, the party of the Sad'ducees, and filled with jealousy
5.18 they arrested the apostles and put them in the common prison. 
5.19 But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out and said, 
5.20 "Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life." 
5.21 And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and taught. Now the high priest came and those who were with him and called together the council and all the senate of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
5.22 But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported, 
5.23 "We found the prison securely locked and the sentries standing at the doors, but when we opened it we found no one inside." 
5.24 Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to. 
5.25 And some one came and told them, "The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people." 
5.26 Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but without violence, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people. 
5.27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them,
5.28 saying, "We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us." 
5.29 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men. 
5.30 The God of our fathers raised Jesus whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. 
5.31 God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. 
5.32 And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him." 
5.33 When they heard this they were enraged and wanted to kill them.
5.34 But a Pharisee in the council named Gama'li-el, a teacher of the law, held in honor by all the people, stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a while. 
5.35 And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you do with these men. 
5.36 For before these days Theu'das arose, giving himself out to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him; but he was slain and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. 
5.37 After him Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him; he also perished, and all who followed him were scattered. 
5.38 So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this plan or this undertaking is of men, it will fail; 
5.39 but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!" 
5.40 So they took his advice, and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
5.41 Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name. 
5.42 And every day in the temple and at home they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ. 
6.1 Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, the Hellenists murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution.
6.2 And the twelve summoned the body of the disciples and said, "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. 
6.3 Therefore, brethren, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty. 
6.4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word." 
6.5 And what they said pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Proch'orus, and Nica'nor, and Ti'mon, and Par'menas, and Nicola'us, a proselyte of Antioch. 
6.6 These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands upon them. 
6.7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith.
6.8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.
6.9 Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyre'nians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cili'cia and Asia, arose and disputed with Stephen. 
6.10 But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. 
6.11 Then they secretly instigated men, who said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God." 
6.12 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, 
6.13 and set up false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law; 
6.14 for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us." 
6.15 And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel. 
7.1 And the high priest said, "Is this so?"
7.2 And Stephen said: "Brethren and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopota'mia, before he lived in Haran, 
7.3 and said to him, `Depart from your land and from your kindred and go into the land which I will show you.' 
7.4 Then he departed from the land of the Chalde'ans, and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living; 
7.5 yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him in possession and to his posterity after him, though he had no child. 
7.6 And God spoke to this effect, that his posterity would be aliens in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and ill-treat them four hundred years. 
7.7 `But I will judge the nation which they serve,' said God, `and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.' 
7.8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs. 
7.9 "And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him,
7.10 and rescued him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him governor over Egypt and over all his household. 
7.11 Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. 
7.12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time. 
7.13 And at the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh. 
7.14 And Joseph sent and called to him Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five souls; 
7.15 and Jacob went down into Egypt. And he died, himself and our fathers, 
7.16 and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. 
7.17 "But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt
7.18 till there arose over Egypt another king who had not known Joseph. 
7.19 He dealt craftily with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, that they might not be kept alive. 
7.20 At this time Moses was born, and was beautiful before God. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house; 
7.21 and when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. 
7.22 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds. 
7.23 "When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.
7.24 And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking the Egyptian. 
7.25 He supposed that his brethren understood that God was giving them deliverance by his hand, but they did not understand. 
7.26 And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and would have reconciled them, saying, `Men, you are brethren, why do you wrong each other?' 
7.27 But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, `Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? 
7.28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' 
7.29 At this retort Moses fled, and became an exile in the land of Mid'ian, where he became the father of two sons. 
7.30 "Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
7.31 When Moses saw it he wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to look, the voice of the Lord came, 
7.32 `I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' And Moses trembled and did not dare to look. 
7.33 And the Lord said to him, `Take off the shoes from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. 
7.34 I have surely seen the ill-treatment of my people that are in Egypt and heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.' 
7.35 "This Moses whom they refused, saying, `Who made you a ruler and a judge?' God sent as both ruler and deliverer by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
7.36 He led them out, having performed wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years. 
7.37 This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, `God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren as he raised me up.' 
7.38 This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living oracles to give to us. 
7.39 Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt, 
7.40 saying to Aaron, `Make for us gods to go before us; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.' 
7.41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and rejoiced in the works of their hands. 
7.42 But God turned and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: `Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices, forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
7.43 And you took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of the god Rephan, the figures which you made to worship; and I will remove you beyond Babylon.'
7.44 "Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, even as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen.
7.45 Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations which God thrust out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David, 
7.46 who found favor in the sight of God and asked leave to find a habitation for the God of Jacob. 
7.47 But it was Solomon who built a house for him. 
7.48 Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made with hands; as the prophet says, 
7.49 `Heaven is my throne, and earth my footstool. What house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?
7.50 Did not my hand make all these things?'
7.51 "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you.
7.52 Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, 
7.53 you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it." 
7.54 Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth against him.
7.55 But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; 
7.56 and he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God." 
7.57 But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together upon him. 
7.58 Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. 
7.59 And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." 
7.60 And he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." And when he had said this, he fell asleep. 
8.1 And Saul was consenting to his death. And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Sama'ria, except the apostles.
8.2 Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him. 
8.3 But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison. 
8.4 Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
8.5 Philip went down to a city of Sama'ria, and proclaimed to them the Christ. 
8.6 And the multitudes with one accord gave heed to what was said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs which he did. 
8.7 For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. 
8.8 So there was much joy in that city. 
8.9 But there was a man named Simon who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the nation of Sama'ria, saying that he himself was somebody great.
8.10 They all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is that power of God which is called Great." 
8.11 And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. 
8.12 But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
8.13 Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed. 
8.14 Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Sama'ria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,
8.15 who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit; 
8.16 for it had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
8.17 Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 
8.18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, 
8.19 saying, "Give me also this power, that any one on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit." 
8.20 But Peter said to him, "Your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! 
8.21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. 
8.22 Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. 
8.23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity." 
8.24 And Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me." 
8.25 Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
8.26 But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." This is a desert road.
8.27 And he rose and went. And behold, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a minister of the Can'dace, queen of the Ethiopians, in charge of all her treasure, had come to Jerusalem to worship 
8.28 and was returning; seated in his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah. 
8.29 And the Spirit said to Philip, "Go up and join this chariot." 
8.30 So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?" 
8.31 And he said, "How can I, unless some one guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 
8.32 Now the passage of the scripture which he was reading was this: "As a sheep led to the slaughter or a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.
8.33 In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken up from the earth."
8.34 And the eunuch said to Philip, "About whom, pray, does the prophet say this, about himself or about some one else?" 
8.35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus. 
8.36 And as they went along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "See, here is water! What is to prevent my being baptized?" 
8.37 /* no scripture */
8.38 And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 
8.39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. 
8.40 But Philip was found at Azo'tus, and passing on he preached the gospel to all the towns till he came to Caesare'a. 
9.1 But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
9.2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 
9.3 Now as he journeyed he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed about him. 
9.4 And he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" 
9.5 And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting; 
9.6 but rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do." 
9.7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. 
9.8 Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes were opened, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 
9.9 And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank. 
9.10 Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Anani'as. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Anani'as." And he said, "Here I am, Lord."
9.11 And the Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying, 
9.12 and he has seen a man named Anani'as come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight." 
9.13 But Anani'as answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem; 
9.14 and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name." 
9.15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel; 
9.16 for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name." 
9.17 So Anani'as departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." 
9.18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized, 
9.19 and took food and was strengthened. For several days he was with the disciples at Damascus.
9.20 And in the synagogues immediately he proclaimed Jesus, saying, "He is the Son of God." 
9.21 And all who heard him were amazed, and said, "Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name? And he has come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests." 
9.22 But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ. 
9.23 When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,
9.24 but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him; 
9.25 but his disciples took him by night and let him down over the wall, lowering him in a basket. 
9.26 And when he had come to Jerusalem he attempted to join the disciples; and they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
9.27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. 
9.28 So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, 
9.29 preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists; but they were seeking to kill him. 
9.30 And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesare'a, and sent him off to Tarsus. 
9.31 So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Sama'ria had peace and was built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied.
9.32 Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints that lived at Lydda.
9.33 There he found a man named Aene'as, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. 
9.34 And Peter said to him, "Aene'as, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed." And immediately he rose. 
9.35 And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. 
9.36 Now there was at Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which means Dorcas. She was full of good works and 
9.37 In those days she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. 
9.38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him entreating him, "Please come to us without delay." 
9.39 So Peter rose and went with them. And when he had come, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping, and showing tunics and other garments which Dorcas made while she was with them. 
9.40 But Peter put them all outside and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, rise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. 
9.41 And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive. 
9.42 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 
9.43 And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner. 
10.1 At Caesare'a there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,
10.2 a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms liberally to the people, and prayed constantly to God. 
10.3 About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, "Cornelius." 
10.4 And he stared at him in terror, and said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. 
10.5 And now send men to Joppa, and bring one Simon who is called Peter; 
10.6 he is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside." 
10.7 When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those that waited on him, 
10.8 and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. 
10.9 The next day, as they were on their journey and coming near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.
10.10 And he became hungry and desired something to eat; but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance 
10.11 and saw the heaven opened, and something descending, like a great sheet, let down by four corners upon the earth. 
10.12 In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. 
10.13 And there came a voice to him, "Rise, Peter; kill and eat." 
10.14 But Peter said, "No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean." 
10.15 And the voice came to him again a second time, "What God has cleansed, you must not call common." 
10.16 This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven. 
10.17 Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate
10.18 and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there. 
10.19 And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you. 
10.20 Rise and go down, and accompany them without hesitation; for I have sent them." 
10.21 And Peter went down to the men and said, "I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for your coming?" 
10.22 And they said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear what you have to say." 
10.23 So he called them in to be his guests. The next day he rose and went off with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
10.24 And on the following day they entered Caesare'a. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his kinsmen and close friends. 
10.25 When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. 
10.26 But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am a man." 
10.27 And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered; 
10.28 and he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean. 
10.29 So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me." 
10.30 And Cornelius said, "Four days ago, about this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel,
10.31 saying, `Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. 
10.32 Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the seaside.' 
10.33 So I sent to you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord." 
10.34 And Peter opened his mouth and said: "Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality,
10.35 but in every nation any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. 
10.36 You know the word which he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), 
10.37 the word which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: 
10.38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. 
10.39 And we are witnesses to all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree; 
10.40 but God raised him on the third day and made him manifest; 
10.41 not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 
10.42 And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one ordained by God to be judge of the living and the dead. 
10.43 To him all the prophets bear witness that every one who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name." 
10.44 While Peter was still saying this, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.
10.45 And the believers from among the circumcised who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. 
10.46 For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, 
10.47 "Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" 
10.48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days. 
11.1 Now the apostles and the brethren who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
11.2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, 
11.3 saying, "Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?" 
11.4 But Peter began and explained to them in order: 
11.5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, something descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came down to me. 
11.6 Looking at it closely I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. 
11.7 And I heard a voice saying to me, `Rise, Peter; kill and eat.' 
11.8 But I said, `No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' 
11.9 But the voice answered a second time from heaven, `What God has cleansed you must not call common.' 
11.10 This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. 
11.11 At that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesare'a. 
11.12 And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brethren also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house. 
11.13 And he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, `Send to Joppa and bring Simon called Peter; 
11.14 he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.' 
11.15 As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. 
11.16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, `John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' 
11.17 If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?" 
11.18 When they heard this they were silenced. And they glorified God, saying, "Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life." 
11.19 Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoeni'cia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none except Jews.
11.20 But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyre'ne, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, preaching the Lord Jesus. 
11.21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number that believed turned to the Lord. 
11.22 News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
11.23 When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad; and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose; 
11.24 for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large company was added to the Lord. 
11.25 So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul; 
11.26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church, and taught a large company of people; and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians. 
11.27 Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
11.28 And one of them named Ag'abus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world; and this took place in the days of Claudius. 
11.29 And the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brethren who lived in Judea; 
11.30 and they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. 
12.1 About that time Herod the king laid violent hands upon some who belonged to the church.
12.2 He killed James the brother of John with the sword; 
12.3 and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. 
12.4 And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. 
12.5 So Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church. 
12.6 The very night when Herod was about to bring him out, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison;
12.7 and behold, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." And the chains fell off his hands. 
12.8 And the angel said to him, "Dress yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he said to him, "Wrap your mantle around you and follow me." 
12.9 And he went out and followed him; he did not know that what was done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. 
12.10 When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one street; and immediately the angel left him. 
12.11 And Peter came to himself, and said, "Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting." 
12.12 When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
12.13 And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a maid named Rhoda came to answer. 
12.14 Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and told that Peter was standing at the gate. 
12.15 They said to her, "You are mad." But she insisted that it was so. They said, "It is his angel!" 
12.16 But Peter continued knocking; and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed. 
12.17 But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Tell this to James and to the brethren." Then he departed and went to another place. 
12.18 Now when day came, there was no small stir among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
12.19 And when Herod had sought for him and could not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesare'a, and remained there. 
12.20 Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they came to him in a body, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.
12.21 On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and made an oration to them. 
12.22 And the people shouted, "The voice of a god, and not of man!" 
12.23 Immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he did not give God the glory; and he was eaten by worms and died. 
12.24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.
12.25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission, bringing with them John whose other name was Mark. 
13.1 Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyre'ne, Man'a-en a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
13.2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them." 
13.3 Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off. 
13.4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleu'cia; and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
13.5 When they arrived at Sal'amis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them. 
13.6 When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus. 
13.7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. 
13.8 But El'ymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. 
13.9 But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him 
13.10 and said, "You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? 
13.11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind and unable to see the sun for a time." Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. 
13.12 Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord. 
13.13 Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphyl'ia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem;
13.14 but they passed on from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisid'ia. And on the sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. 
13.15 After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, "Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it." 
13.16 So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: "Men of Israel, and you that fear God, listen.
13.17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. 
13.18 And for about forty years he bore with them in the wilderness. 
13.19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years. 
13.20 And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. 
13.21 Then they asked for a king; and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. 
13.22 And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; of whom he testified and said, `I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.' 
13.23 Of this man's posterity God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. 
13.24 Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 
13.25 And as John was finishing his course, he said, `What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.' 
13.26 "Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.
13.27 For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him. 
13.28 Though they could charge him with nothing deserving death, yet they asked Pilate to have him killed. 
13.29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb. 
13.30 But God raised him from the dead; 
13.31 and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. 
13.32 And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, 
13.33 this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, `Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee.'
13.34 And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he spoke in this way, `I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
13.35 Therefore he says also in another psalm, `Thou wilt not let thy Holy One see corruption.'
13.36 For David, after he had served the counsel of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers, and saw corruption; 
13.37 but he whom God raised up saw no corruption. 
13.38 Let it be known to you therefore, brethren, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, 
13.39 and by him every one that believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. 
13.40 Beware, therefore, lest there come upon you what is said in the prophets: 
13.41 `Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I do a deed in your days, a deed you will never believe, if one declares it to you.'"
13.42 As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next sabbath.
13.43 And when the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God. 
13.44 The next sabbath almost the whole city gathered together to hear the word of God.
13.45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and reviled him. 
13.46 And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, "It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles. 
13.47 For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, `I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"
13.48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of God; and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
13.49 And the word of the Lord spread throughout all the region. 
13.50 But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. 
13.51 But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and went to Ico'nium. 
13.52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. 
14.1 Now at Ico'nium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue, and so spoke that a great company believed, both of Jews and of Greeks.
14.2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren. 
14.3 So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 
14.4 But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles. 
14.5 When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to molest them and to stone them, 
14.6 they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycao'nia, and to the surrounding country; 
14.7 and there they preached the gospel. 
14.8 Now at Lystra there was a man sitting, who could not use his feet; he was a cripple from birth, who had never walked.
14.9 He listened to Paul speaking; and Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, 
14.10 said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he sprang up and walked. 
14.11 And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycao'nian, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!" 
14.12 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, because he was the chief speaker, they called Hermes. 
14.13 And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the people. 
14.14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out among the multitude, crying, 
14.15 "Men, why are you doing this? We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. 
14.16 In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways; 
14.17 yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness." 
14.18 With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them. 
14.19 But Jews came there from Antioch and Ico'nium; and having persuaded the people, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
14.20 But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city; and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. 
14.21 When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Ico'nium and to Antioch, 
14.22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. 
14.23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed. 
14.24 Then they passed through Pisid'ia, and came to Pamphyl'ia.
14.25 And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attali'a; 
14.26 and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled. 
14.27 And when they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. 
14.28 And they remained no little time with the disciples. 
15.1 But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brethren, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
15.2 And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. 
15.3 So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoeni'cia and Sama'ria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and they gave great joy to all the brethren. 
15.4 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them. 
15.5 But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up, and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses." 
15.6 The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.
15.7 And after there had been much debate, Peter rose and said to them, "Brethren, you know that in the early days God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. 
15.8 And God who knows the heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us; 
15.9 and he made no distinction between us and them, but cleansed their hearts by faith. 
15.10 Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? 
15.11 But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will." 
15.12 And all the assembly kept silence; and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
15.13 After they finished speaking, James replied, "Brethren, listen to me. 
15.14 Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 
15.15 And with this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written, 
15.16 `After this I will return, and I will rebuild the dwelling of David, which has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will set it up,
15.17 that the rest of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name,
15.18 says the Lord, who has made these things known from of old.'
15.19 Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, 
15.20 but should write to them to abstain from the pollutions of idols and from unchastity and from what is strangled and from blood. 
15.21 For from early generations Moses has had in every city those who preach him, for he is read every sabbath in the synagogues." 
15.22 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsab'bas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,
15.23 with the following letter: "The brethren, both the apostles and the elders, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cili'cia, greeting. 
15.24 Since we have heard that some persons from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, 
15.25 it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
15.26 men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
15.27 We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. 
15.28 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: 
15.29 that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from unchastity. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell." 
15.30 So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
15.31 And when they read it, they rejoiced at the exhortation. 
15.32 And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words and strengthened them. 
15.33 And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them. 
15.34 /* no scripture */
15.35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. 
15.36 And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Come, let us return and visit the brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are."
15.37 And Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. 
15.38 But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphyl'ia, and had not gone with them to the work. 
15.39 And there arose a sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, 
15.40 but Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord. 
15.41 And he went through Syria and Cili'cia, strengthening the churches. 
16.1 And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek.
16.2 He was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Ico'nium. 
16.3 Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. 
16.4 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem. 
16.5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily. 
16.6 And they went through the region of Phry'gia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
16.7 And when they had come opposite My'sia, they attempted to go into Bithyn'ia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them; 
16.8 so, passing by My'sia, they went down to Tro'as. 
16.9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedo'nia was standing beseeching him and saying, "Come over to Macedo'nia and help us." 
16.10 And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedo'nia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. 
16.11 Setting sail therefore from Tro'as, we made a direct voyage to Sam'othrace, and the following day to Ne-ap'olis,
16.12 and from there to Philip'pi, which is the leading city of the district of Macedo'nia, and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days; 
16.13 and on the sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. 
16.14 One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyati'ra, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to give heed to what was said by Paul. 
16.15 And when she was baptized, with her household, she besought us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay." And she prevailed upon us. 
16.16 As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by soothsaying.
16.17 She followed Paul and us, crying, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation." 
16.18 And this she did for many days. But Paul was annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour. 
16.19 But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the rulers;
16.20 and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, "These men are Jews and they are disturbing our city. 
16.21 They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice." 
16.22 The crowd joined in attacking them; and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. 
16.23 And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely. 
16.24 Having received this charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. 
16.25 But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,
16.26 and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and every one's fetters were unfastened. 
16.27 When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. 
16.28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here." 
16.29 And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas, 
16.30 and brought them out and said, "Men, what must I do to be saved?" 
16.31 And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household." 
16.32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all that were in his house. 
16.33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their wounds, and he was baptized at once, with all his family. 
16.34 Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with all his household that he had believed in God. 
16.35 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, "Let those men go." 
16.36 And the jailer reported the words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore come out and go in peace." 
16.37 But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No! let them come themselves and take us out." 
16.38 The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens; 
16.39 so they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. 
16.40 So they went out of the prison, and visited Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they exhorted them and departed. 
17.1 Now when they had passed through Amphip'olis and Apollo'nia, they came to Thessaloni'ca, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
17.2 And Paul went in, as was his custom, and for three weeks he argued with them from the scriptures, 
17.3 explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ." 
17.4 And some of them were persuaded, and joined Paul and Silas; as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. 
17.5 But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked fellows of the rabble, they gathered a crowd, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the people. 
17.6 And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brethren before the city authorities, crying, "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, 
17.7 and Jason has received them; and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus." 
17.8 And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard this. 
17.9 And when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go. 
17.10 The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroe'a; and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue.
17.11 Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessaloni'ca, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so. 
17.12 Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men. 
17.13 But when the Jews of Thessaloni'ca learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroe'a also, they came there too, stirring up and inciting the crowds. 
17.14 Then the brethren immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there. 
17.15 Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed. 
17.16 Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.
17.17 So he argued in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the market place every day with those who chanced to be there. 
17.18 Some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers met him. And some said, "What would this babbler say?" Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities" -- because he preached Jesus and the resurrection. 
17.19 And they took hold of him and brought him to the Are-op'agus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is which you present? 
17.20 For you bring some strange things to our ears; we wish to know therefore what these things mean." 
17.21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new. 
17.22 So Paul, standing in the middle of the Are-op'agus, said: "Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.
17.23 For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, `To an unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. 
17.24 The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by man, 
17.25 nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything. 
17.26 And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation, 
17.27 that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us, 
17.28 for `In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your poets have said, `For we are indeed his offspring.'
17.29 Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, a representation by the art and imagination of man.
17.30 The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent, 
17.31 because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead." 
17.32 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, "We will hear you again about this."
17.33 So Paul went out from among them. 
17.34 But some men joined him and believed, among them Dionys'ius the Are-op'agite and a woman named Dam'aris and others with them. 
18.1 After this he left Athens and went to Corinth.
18.2 And he found a Jew named Aq'uila, a native of Pontus, lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them; 
18.3 and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked, for by trade they were tentmakers. 
18.4 And he argued in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks. 
18.5 When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedo'nia, Paul was occupied with preaching, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus.
18.6 And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles." 
18.7 And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God; his house was next door to the synagogue. 
18.8 Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized. 
18.9 And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, "Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent; 
18.10 for I am with you, and no man shall attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city." 
18.11 And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 
18.12 But when Gallio was proconsul of Acha'ia, the Jews made a united attack upon Paul and brought him before the tribunal,
18.13 saying, "This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law." 
18.14 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, I should have reason to bear with you, O Jews; 
18.15 but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things." 
18.16 And he drove them from the tribunal. 
18.17 And they all seized Sos'thenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to this. 
18.18 After this Paul stayed many days longer, and then took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aq'uila. At Cen'chre-ae he cut his hair, for he had a vow.
18.19 And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself went into the synagogue and argued with the Jews. 
18.20 When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined; 
18.21 but on taking leave of them he said, "I will return to you if God wills," and he set sail from Ephesus. 
18.22 When he had landed at Caesare'a, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.
18.23 After spending some time there he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phryg'ia, strengthening all the disciples. 
18.24 Now a Jew named Apol'los, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the scriptures.
18.25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. 
18.26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but when Priscilla and Aq'uila heard him, they took him and expounded to him the way of God more accurately. 
18.27 And when he wished to cross to Acha'ia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, 
18.28 for he powerfully confuted the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus. 
19.1 While Apol'los was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
19.2 And he said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they said, "No, we have never even heard that there is a Holy Spirit." 
19.3 And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John's baptism." 
19.4 And Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus." 
19.5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
19.6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied. 
19.7 There were about twelve of them in all. 
19.8 And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, arguing and pleading about the kingdom of God;
19.9 but when some were stubborn and disbelieved, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them, taking the disciples with him, and argued daily in the hall of Tyran'nus. 
19.10 This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. 
19.11 And God did extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,
19.12 so that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. 
19.13 Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches." 
19.14 Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. 
19.15 But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?" 
19.16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, mastered all of them, and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
19.17 And this became known to all residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks; and fear fell upon them all; and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled. 
19.18 Many also of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices. 
19.19 And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
19.20 So the word of the Lord grew and prevailed mightily. 
19.21 Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedo'nia and Acha'ia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
19.22 And having sent into Macedo'nia two of his helpers, Timothy and Eras'tus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while. 
19.23 About that time there arose no little stir concerning the Way.
19.24 For a man named Deme'trius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Ar'temis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. 
19.25 These he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation, and said, "Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth. 
19.26 And you see and hear that not only at Ephesus but almost throughout all Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable company of people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods. 
19.27 And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Ar'temis may count for nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship." 
19.28 When they heard this they were enraged, and cried out, "Great is Ar'temis of the Ephesians!"
19.29 So the city was filled with the confusion; and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Ga'ius and Aristar'chus, Macedo'nians who were Paul's companions in travel. 
19.30 Paul wished to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not let him; 
19.31 some of the A'si-archs also, who were friends of his, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater. 
19.32 Now some cried one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. 
19.33 Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a defense to the people. 
19.34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice cried out, "Great is Ar'temis of the Ephesians!" 
19.35 And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Ar'temis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky? 
19.36 Seeing then that these things cannot be contradicted, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. 
19.37 For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess. 
19.38 If therefore Deme'trius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against any one, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another. 
19.39 But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. 
19.40 For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, there being no cause that we can give to justify this commotion." 
19.41 And when he had said this, he dismissed the assembly. 
20.1 After the uproar ceased, Paul sent for the disciples and having exhorted them took leave of them and departed for Macedo'nia.
20.2 When he had gone through these parts and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece. 
20.3 There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he determined to return through Macedo'nia. 
20.4 Sop'ater of Beroe'a, the son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him; and of the Thessalo'nians, Aristar'chus and Secun'dus; and Ga'ius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tych'icus and Troph'imus. 
20.5 These went on and were waiting for us at Tro'as, 
20.6 but we sailed away from Philip'pi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Tro'as, where we stayed for seven days. 
20.7 On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and he prolonged his speech until midnight.
20.8 There were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered. 
20.9 And a young man named Eu'tychus was sitting in the window. He sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer; and being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. 
20.10 But Paul went down and bent over him, and embracing him said, "Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him." 
20.11 And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed. 
20.12 And they took the lad away alive, and were not a little comforted. 
20.13 But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.
20.14 And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mityle'ne. 
20.15 And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chi'os; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we came to Mile'tus. 
20.16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost. 
20.17 And from Mile'tus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.
20.18 And when they came to him, he said to them: "You yourselves know how I lived among you all the time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,
20.19 serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which befell me through the plots of the Jews; 
20.20 how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, 
20.21 testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance to God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. 
20.22 And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what shall befall me there; 
20.23 except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. 
20.24 But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. 
20.25 And now, behold, I know that all you among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom will see my face no more. 
20.26 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you, 
20.27 for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. 
20.28 Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God which he obtained with the blood of his own Son. 
20.29 I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; 
20.30 and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. 
20.31 Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. 
20.32 And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. 
20.33 I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel. 
20.34 You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those who were with me. 
20.35 In all things I have shown you that by so toiling one must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, `It is more blessed to give than to receive.'" 
20.36 And when he had spoken thus, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
20.37 And they all wept and embraced Paul and kissed him, 
20.38 sorrowing most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him to the ship. 
21.1 And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Pat'ara.
21.2 And having found a ship crossing to Phoeni'cia, we went aboard, and set sail. 
21.3 When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo. 
21.4 And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. 
21.5 And when our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey; and they all, with wives and children, brought us on our way till we were outside the city; and kneeling down on the beach we prayed and bade one another farewell. 
21.6 Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home. 
21.7 When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolema'is; and we greeted the brethren and stayed with them for one day.
21.8 On the morrow we departed and came to Caesare'a; and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. 
21.9 And he had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied. 
21.10 While we were staying for some days, a prophet named Ag'abus came down from Judea. 
21.11 And coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, `So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this girdle and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'" 
21.12 When we heard this, we and the people there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
21.13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus." 
21.14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, "The will of the Lord be done." 
21.15 After these days we made ready and went up to Jerusalem.
21.16 And some of the disciples from Caesare'a went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge. 
21.17 When we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
21.18 On the following day Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present. 
21.19 After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. 
21.20 And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; they are all zealous for the law, 
21.21 and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs. 
21.22 What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. 
21.23 Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; 
21.24 take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you but that you yourself live in observance of the law. 
21.25 But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from unchastity." 
21.26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself with them and went into the temple, to give notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for every one of them. 
21.27 When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, who had seen him in the temple, stirred up all the crowd, and laid hands on him,
21.28 crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching men everywhere against the people and the law and this place; moreover he also brought Greeks into the temple, and he has defiled this holy place." 
21.29 For they had previously seen Troph'imus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. 
21.30 Then all the city was aroused, and the people ran together; they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. 
21.31 And as they were trying to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. 
21.32 He at once took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
21.33 Then the tribune came up and arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done. 
21.34 Some in the crowd shouted one thing, some another; and as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks. 
21.35 And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd; 
21.36 for the mob of the people followed, crying, "Away with him!" 
21.37 As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, "May I say something to you?" And he said, "Do you know Greek?
21.38 Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?" 
21.39 Paul replied, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cili'cia, a citizen of no mean city; I beg you, let me speak to the people." 
21.40 And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great hush, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying: 
22.1 "Brethren and fathers, hear the defense which I now make before you."
22.2 And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew language, they were the more quiet. And he said:
22.3 "I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cili'cia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gama'li-el, educated according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as you all are this day.
22.4 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, 
22.5 as the high priest and the whole council of elders bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brethren, and I journeyed to Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished. 
22.6 "As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone about me.
22.7 And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?' 
22.8 And I answered, `Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, `I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.' 
22.9 Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who was speaking to me. 
22.10 And I said, `What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, `Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.' 
22.11 And when I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus. 
22.12 "And one Anani'as, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
22.13 came to me, and standing by me said to me, `Brother Saul, receive your sight.' And in that very hour I received my sight and saw him. 
22.14 And he said, `The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Just One and to hear a voice from his mouth; 
22.15 for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard. 
22.16 And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.' 
22.17 "When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
22.18 and saw him saying to me, `Make haste and get quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony about me.' 
22.19 And I said, `Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in thee. 
22.20 And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I also was standing by and approving, and keeping the garments of those who killed him.' 
22.21 And he said to me, `Depart; for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'" 
22.22 Up to this word they listened to him; then they lifted up their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he ought not to live."
22.23 And as they cried out and waved their garments and threw dust into the air, 
22.24 the tribune commanded him to be brought into the barracks, and ordered him to be examined by scourging, to find out why they shouted thus against him. 
22.25 But when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen, and uncondemned?" 
22.26 When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen." 
22.27 So the tribune came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" And he said, "Yes." 
22.28 The tribune answered, "I bought this citizenship for a large sum." Paul said, "But I was born a citizen." 
22.29 So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him instantly; and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him. 
22.30 But on the morrow, desiring to know the real reason why the Jews accused him, he unbound him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.
23.1 And Paul, looking intently at the council, said, "Brethren, I have lived before God in all good conscience up to this day."
23.2 And the high priest Anani'as commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. 
23.3 Then Paul said to him, "God shall strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?" 
23.4 Those who stood by said, "Would you revile God's high priest?" 
23.5 And Paul said, "I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, `You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'" 
23.6 But when Paul perceived that one part were Sad'ducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Brethren, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead I am on trial."
23.7 And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sad'ducees; and the assembly was divided. 
23.8 For the Sad'ducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. 
23.9 Then a great clamor arose; and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?" 
23.10 And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the barracks. 
23.11 The following night the Lord stood by him and said, "Take courage, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must bear witness also at Rome."
23.12 When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
23.13 There were more than forty who made this conspiracy. 
23.14 And they went to the chief priests and elders, and said, "We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul. 
23.15 You therefore, along with the council, give notice now to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near." 
23.16 Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush; so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.
23.17 And Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the tribune; for he has something to tell him." 
23.18 So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, "Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you." 
23.19 The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?" 
23.20 And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him. 
23.21 But do not yield to them; for more than forty of their men lie in ambush for him, having bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you." 
23.22 So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, "Tell no one that you have informed me of this." 
23.23 Then he called two of the centurions and said, "At the third hour of the night get ready two hundred soldiers with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesare'a.
23.24 Also provide mounts for Paul to ride, and bring him safely to Felix the governor." 
23.25 And he wrote a letter to this effect: 
23.26 "Claudius Lys'ias to his Excellency the governor Felix, greeting.
23.27 This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed by them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen. 
23.28 And desiring to know the charge on which they accused him, I brought him down to their council. 
23.29 I found that he was accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment. 
23.30 And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him." 
23.31 So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antip'atris.
23.32 And on the morrow they returned to the barracks, leaving the horsemen to go on with him. 
23.33 When they came to Caesare'a and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him. 
23.34 On reading the letter, he asked to what province he belonged. When he learned that he was from Cili'cia 
23.35 he said, "I will hear you when your accusers arrive." And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium. 
24.1 And after five days the high priest Anani'as came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertul'lus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul;
24.2 and when he was called, Tertul'lus began to accuse him, saying: "Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your provision, most excellent Felix, reforms are introduced on behalf of this nation,
24.3 in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude. 
24.4 But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. 
24.5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, an agitator among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. 
24.6 He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. 
24.7 /* no scripture */
24.8 By examining him yourself you will be able to learn from him about everything of which we accuse him." 
24.9 The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all this was so.
24.10 And when the governor had motioned to him to speak, Paul replied: "Realizing that for many years you have been judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.
24.11 As you may ascertain, it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem; 
24.12 and they did not find me disputing with any one or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues, or in the city. 
24.13 Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me. 
24.14 But this I admit to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the law or written in the prophets, 
24.15 having a hope in God which these themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. 
24.16 So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward God and toward men. 
24.17 Now after some years I came to bring to my nation alms and offerings. 
24.18 As I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia -- 
24.19 they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, if they have anything against me. 
24.20 Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council, 
24.21 except this one thing which I cried out while standing among them, `With respect to the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you this day.'" 
24.22 But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lys'ias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case."
24.23 Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but should have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs. 
24.24 After some days Felix came with his wife Drusil'la, who was a Jewess; and he sent for Paul and heard him speak upon faith in Christ Jesus.
24.25 And as he argued about justice and self-control and future judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, "Go away for the present; when I have an opportunity I will summon you." 
24.26 At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him. 
24.27 But when two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison. 
25.1 Now when Festus had come into his province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from Caesare'a.
25.2 And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they urged him, 
25.3 asking as a favor to have the man sent to Jerusalem, planning an ambush to kill him on the way. 
25.4 Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesare'a, and that he himself intended to go there shortly. 
25.5 "So," said he, "let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them accuse him." 
25.6 When he had stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesare'a; and the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.
25.7 And when he had come, the Jews who had gone down from Jerusalem stood about him, bringing against him many serious charges which they could not prove. 
25.8 Paul said in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended at all." 
25.9 But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, "Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem, and there be tried on these charges before me?" 
25.10 But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried; to the Jews I have done no wrong, as you know very well. 
25.11 If then I am a wrongdoer, and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death; but if there is nothing in their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar." 
25.12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, "You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go." 
25.13 Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Berni'ce arrived at Caesare'a to welcome Festus.
25.14 And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a man left prisoner by Felix; 
25.15 and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information about him, asking for sentence against him. 
25.16 I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one before the accused met the accusers face to face, and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. 
25.17 When therefore they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in. 
25.18 When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed; 
25.19 but they had certain points of dispute with him about their own superstition and about one Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. 
25.20 Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wished to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. 
25.21 But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be held until I could send him to Caesar." 
25.22 And Agrippa said to Festus, "I should like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," said he, "you shall hear him." 
25.23 So on the morrow Agrippa and Berni'ce came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then by command of Festus Paul was brought in.
25.24 And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. 
25.25 But I found that he had done nothing deserving death; and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him. 
25.26 But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you, and, especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write. 
25.27 For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him." 
26.1 Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:
26.2 "I think myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,
26.3 because you are especially familiar with all customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently. 
26.4 "My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews.
26.5 They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee. 
26.6 And now I stand here on trial for hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, 
26.7 to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king! 
26.8 Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead? 
26.9 "I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
26.10 And I did so in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them. 
26.11 And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme; and in raging fury against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities. 
26.12 "Thus I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
26.13 At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining round me and those who journeyed with me. 
26.14 And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, `Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It hurts you to kick against the goads.' 
26.15 And I said, `Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, `I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. 
26.16 But rise and stand upon your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you to serve and bear witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you, 
26.17 delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles -- to whom I send you 
26.18 to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.' 
26.19 "Wherefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
26.20 but declared first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance. 
26.21 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. 
26.22 To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass: 
26.23 that the Christ must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles." 
26.24 And as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are mad; your great learning is turning you mad."
26.25 But Paul said, "I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth. 
26.26 For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner. 
26.27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe." 
26.28 And Agrippa said to Paul, "In a short time you think to make me a Christian!" 
26.29 And Paul said, "Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am -- except for these chains." 
26.30 Then the king rose, and the governor and Berni'ce and those who were sitting with them;
26.31 and when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment." 
26.32 And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar." 
27.1 And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort, named Julius.
27.2 And embarking in a ship of Adramyt'tium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristar'chus, a Macedo'nian from Thessaloni'ca. 
27.3 The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul kindly, and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for. 
27.4 And putting to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. 
27.5 And when we had sailed across the sea which is off Cili'cia and Pamphyl'ia, we came to Myra in Ly'cia. 
27.6 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, and put us on board. 
27.7 We sailed slowly for a number of days, and arrived with difficulty off Cni'dus, and as the wind did not allow us to go on, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmo'ne. 
27.8 Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lase'a. 
27.9 As much time had been lost, and the voyage was already dangerous because the fast had already gone by, Paul advised them,
27.10 saying, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives." 
27.11 But the centurion paid more attention to the captain and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. 
27.12 And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to put to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, looking northeast and southeast, and winter there. 
27.13 And when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close inshore.
27.14 But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land; 
27.15 and when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven. 
27.16 And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the boat; 
27.17 after hoisting it up, they took measures to undergird the ship; then, fearing that they should run on the Syr'tis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven. 
27.18 As we were violently storm-tossed, they began next day to throw the cargo overboard; 
27.19 and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackle of the ship. 
27.20 And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many a day, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned. 
27.21 As they had been long without food, Paul then came forward among them and said, "Men, you should have listened to me, and should not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss.
27.22 I now bid you take heart; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. 
27.23 For this very night there stood by me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, 
27.24 and he said, `Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar; and lo, God has granted you all those who sail with you.' 
27.25 So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. 
27.26 But we shall have to run on some island." 
27.27 When the fourteenth night had come, as we were drifting across the sea of A'dria, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.
27.28 So they sounded and found twenty fathoms; a little farther on they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms. 
27.29 And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let out four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come. 
27.30 And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow, 
27.31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved." 
27.32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let it go. 
27.33 As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.
27.34 Therefore I urge you to take some food; it will give you strength, since not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you." 
27.35 And when he had said this, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. 
27.36 Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. 
27.37 (We were in all two hundred and seventy-six persons in the ship.) 
27.38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. 
27.39 Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to bring the ship ashore.
27.40 So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders; then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. 
27.41 But striking a shoal they ran the vessel aground; the bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was broken up by the surf. 
27.42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape; 
27.43 but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their purpose. He ordered those who could swim to throw themselves overboard first and make for the land, 
27.44 and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all escaped to land. 
28.1 After we had escaped, we then learned that the island was called Malta.
28.2 And the natives showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold. 
28.3 Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, when a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand. 
28.4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live."
28.5 He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. 
28.6 They waited, expecting him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead; but when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god. 
28.7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
28.8 It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery; and Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him. 
28.9 And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured. 
28.10 They presented many gifts to us; and when we sailed, they put on board whatever we needed. 
28.11 After three months we set sail in a ship which had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the Twin Brothers as figurehead.
28.12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. 
28.13 And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhe'gium; and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Pute'oli. 
28.14 There we found brethren, and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. 
28.15 And the brethren there, when they heard of us, came as far as the Forum of Ap'pius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them Paul thanked God and took courage. 
28.16 And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him. 
28.17 After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews; and when they had gathered, he said to them, "Brethren, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
28.18 When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. 
28.19 But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar -- though I had no charge to bring against my nation. 
28.20 For this reason therefore I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain." 
28.21 And they said to him, "We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brethren coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you. 
28.22 But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against." 
28.23 When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in great numbers. And he expounded the matter to them from morning till evening, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the law of Moses and from the prophets.
28.24 And some were convinced by what he said, while others disbelieved. 
28.25 So, as they disagreed among themselves, they departed, after Paul had made one statement: "The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet: 
28.26 `Go to this people, and say, You shall indeed hear but never understand, and you shall indeed see but never perceive.
28.27 For this people's heart has grown dull, and their ears are heavy of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should perceive with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal them.'
28.28 Let it be known to you then that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen." 
28.29 /* no scripture */
28.30 And he lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, 
28.31 preaching the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ quite openly and unhindered.
