1.1 In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 
1.2 On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoi'achin), 
1.3 the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chalde'ans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was upon him there. 
1.4 As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness round about it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming bronze.  
1.5 And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the form of men, 
1.6 but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. 
1.7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze. 
1.8 Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus: 
1.9 their wings touched one another; they went every one straight forward, without turning as they went. 
1.10 As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man in front; the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle at the back. 
1.11 Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies. 
1.12 And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went. 
1.13 In the midst of the living creatures there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. 
1.14 And the living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning. 
1.15 Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.  
1.16 As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of a chrysolite; and the four had the same likeness, their construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel. 
1.17 When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. 
1.18 The four wheels had rims and they had spokes; and their rims were full of eyes round about. 
1.19 And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. 
1.20 Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
1.21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
1.22 Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament, shining like crystal, spread out above their heads.  
1.23 And under the firmament their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each creature had two wings covering its body. 
1.24 And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of a host; when they stood still, they let down their wings. 
1.25 And there came a voice from above the firmament over their heads; when they stood still, they let down their wings. 
1.26 And above the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness as it were of a human form.  
1.27 And upward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were gleaming bronze, like the appearance of fire enclosed round about; and downward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him. 
1.28 Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.  
2.1 And he said to me, "Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak with you."  
2.2 And when he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet; and I heard him speaking to me. 
2.3 And he said to me, "Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels, who have rebelled against me; they and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day. 
2.4 The people also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them; and you shall say to them, `Thus says the Lord GOD.' 
2.5 And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that there has been a prophet among them. 
2.6 And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit upon scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house. 
2.7 And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear; for they are a rebellious house. 
2.8 "But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth, and eat what I give you."  
2.9 And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and, lo, a written scroll was in it; 
2.10 and he spread it before me; and it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe. 
3.1 And he said to me, "Son of man, eat what is offered to you; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel." 
3.2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. 
3.3 And he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it." Then I ate it; and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey. 
3.4 And he said to me, "Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.  
3.5 For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel -- 
3.6 not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you. 
3.7 But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they are not willing to listen to me; because all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stubborn heart. 
3.8 Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads. 
3.9 Like adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead; fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house." 
3.10 Moreover he said to me, "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears. 
3.11 And go, get you to the exiles, to your people, and say to them, `Thus says the Lord GOD'; whether they hear or refuse to hear." 
3.12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the LORD arose from its place, I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake;  
3.13 it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, that sounded like a great earthquake. 
3.14 The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me; 
3.15 and I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Chebar. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days. 
3.16 And at the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me:  
3.17 "Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me. 
3.18 If I say to the wicked, `You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. 
3.19 But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life. 
3.20 Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. 
3.21 Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you will have saved your life." 
3.22 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, "Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will speak with you."  
3.23 So I arose and went forth into the plain; and, lo, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory which I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face. 
3.24 But the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself within your house. 
3.25 And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people; 
3.26 and I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be dumb and unable to reprove them; for they are a rebellious house. 
3.27 But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, `Thus says the Lord GOD'; he that will hear, let him hear; and he that will refuse to hear, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house. 
4.1 "And you, O son of man, take a brick and lay it before you, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem;  
4.2 and put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about. 
4.3 And take an iron plate, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel. 
4.4 "Then lie upon your left side, and I will lay the punishment of the house of Israel upon you; for the number of the days that you lie upon it, you shall bear their punishment.  
4.5 For I assign to you a number of days, three hundred and ninety days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment; so long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel. 
4.6 And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah; forty days I assign you, a day for each year. 
4.7 And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared; and you shall prophesy against the city. 
4.8 And, behold, I will put cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege. 
4.9 "And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt, and put them into a single vessel, and make bread of them. During the number of days that you lie upon your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.  
4.10 And the food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; once a day you shall eat it. 
4.11 And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin; once a day you shall drink. 
4.12 And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung." 
4.13 And the LORD said, "Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them." 
4.14 Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! behold, I have never defiled myself; from my youth up till now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has foul flesh come into my mouth." 
4.15 Then he said to me, "See, I will let you have cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread." 
4.16 Moreover he said to me, "Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay. 
4.17 I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and look at one another in dismay, and waste away under their punishment. 
5.1 "And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword; use it as a barber's razor and pass it over your head and your beard; then take balances for weighing, and divide the hair.  
5.2 A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed; and a third part you shall take and strike with the sword round about the city; and a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. 
5.3 And you shall take from these a small number, and bind them in the skirts of your robe. 
5.4 And of these again you shall take some, and cast them into the fire, and burn them in the fire; from there a fire will come forth into all the house of Israel. 
5.5 Thus says the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the center of the nations, with countries round about her. 
5.6 And she has wickedly rebelled against my ordinances more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries round about her, by rejecting my ordinances and not walking in my statutes. 
5.7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes or kept my ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you; 
5.8 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations. 
5.9 And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again. 
5.10 Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in the midst of you, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds. 
5.11 Wherefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will cut you down; my eye will not spare, and I will have no pity. 
5.12 A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in the midst of you; a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them. 
5.13 "Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself; and they shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken in my jealousy, when I spend my fury upon them.  
5.14 Moreover I will make you a desolation and an object of reproach among the nations round about you and in the sight of all that pass by. 
5.15 You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations round about you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious chastisements -- I, the LORD, have spoken -- 
5.16 when I loose against you my deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will loose to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you, and break your staff of bread. 
5.17 I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children; pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword upon you. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
6.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
6.2 "Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, 
6.3 and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. 
6.4 Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain before your idols. 
6.5 And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars. 
6.6 Wherever you dwell your cities shall be waste and your high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out. 
6.7 And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know that I am the LORD. 
6.8 "Yet I will leave some of you alive. When you have among the nations some who escape the sword, and when you are scattered through the countries,  
6.9 then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, when I have broken their wanton heart which has departed from me, and blinded their eyes which turn wantonly after their idols; and they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils which they have committed, for all their abominations. 
6.10 And they shall know that I am the LORD; I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them." 
6.11 Thus says the Lord GOD: "Clap your hands, and stamp your foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.  
6.12 He that is far off shall die of pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them. 
6.13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the mountain tops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing odor to all their idols. 
6.14 And I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land desolate and waste, throughout all their habitations, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
7.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
7.2 "And you, O son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land. 
7.3 Now the end is upon you, and I will let loose my anger upon you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will punish you for all your abominations. 
7.4 And my eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; but I will punish you for your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
7.5 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Disaster after disaster! Behold, it comes.  
7.6 An end has come, the end has come; it has awakened against you. Behold, it comes. 
7.7 Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land; the time has come, the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting upon the mountains. 
7.8 Now I will soon pour out my wrath upon you, and spend my anger against you, and judge you according to your ways; and I will punish you for all your abominations. 
7.9 And my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will punish you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that I am the LORD, who smite. 
7.10 "Behold, the day! Behold, it comes! Your doom has come, injustice has blossomed, pride has budded.  
7.11 Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness; none of them shall remain, nor their abundance, nor their wealth; neither shall there be preeminence among them. 
7.12 The time has come, the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude. 
7.13 For the seller shall not return to what he has sold, while they live. For wrath is upon all their multitude; it shall not turn back; and because of his iniquity, none can maintain his life. 
7.14 "They have blown the trumpet and made all ready; but none goes to battle, for my wrath is upon all their multitude.  
7.15 The sword is without, pestilence and famine are within; he that is in the field dies by the sword; and him that is in the city famine and pestilence devour. 
7.16 And if any survivors escape, they will be on the mountains, like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one over his iniquity. 
7.17 All hands are feeble, and all knees weak as water. 
7.18 They gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror covers them; shame is upon all faces, and baldness on all their heads. 
7.19 They cast their silver into the streets, and their gold is like an unclean thing; their silver and gold are not able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD; they cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it. For it was the stumbling block of their iniquity. 
7.20 Their beautiful ornament they used for vainglory, and they made their abominable images and their detestable things of it; therefore I will make it an unclean thing to them. 
7.21 And I will give it into the hands of foreigners for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it. 
7.22 I will turn my face from them, that they may profane my precious place; robbers shall enter and profane it, 
7.23 and make a desolation. "Because the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence,  
7.24 I will bring the worst of the nations to take possession of their houses; I will put an end to their proud might, and their holy places shall be profaned. 
7.25 When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there shall be none. 
7.26 Disaster comes upon disaster, rumor follows rumor; they seek a vision from the prophet, but the law perishes from the priest, and counsel from the elders. 
7.27 The king mourns, the prince is wrapped in despair, and the hands of the people of the land are palsied by terror. According to their way I will do to them, and according to their own judgments I will judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD." 
8.1 In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.  
8.2 Then I beheld, and, lo, a form that had the appearance of a man; below what appeared to be his loins it was fire, and above his loins it was like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming bronze. 
8.3 He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy. 
8.4 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain. 
8.5 Then he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes now in the direction of the north." So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy.  
8.6 And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations." 
8.7 And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.  
8.8 Then said he to me, "Son of man, dig in the wall"; and when I dug in the wall, lo, there was a door. 
8.9 And he said to me, "Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here." 
8.10 So I went in and saw; and there, portrayed upon the wall round about, were all kinds of creeping things, and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel. 
8.11 And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Ja-azani'ah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up. 
8.12 Then he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, every man in his room of pictures? For they say, `The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.'" 
8.13 He said also to me, "You will see still greater abominations which they commit." 
8.14 Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.  
8.15 Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these." 
8.16 And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD; and behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east.  
8.17 Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too slight a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence, and provoke me further to anger? Lo, they put the branch to their nose. 
8.18 Therefore I will deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them." 
9.1 Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, "Draw near, you executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand."  
9.2 And lo, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, every man with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar. 
9.3 Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherubim on which it rested to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his side.  
9.4 And the LORD said to him, "Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it." 
9.5 And to the others he said in my hearing, "Pass through the city after him, and smite; your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity; 
9.6 slay old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one upon whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were before the house. 
9.7 Then he said to them, "Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth." So they went forth, and smote in the city. 
9.8 And while they were smiting, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face, and cried, "Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all that remains of Israel in the outpouring of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?" 
9.9 Then he said to me, "The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice; for they say, `The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.'  
9.10 As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity, but I will requite their deeds upon their heads." 
9.11 And lo, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his side, brought back word, saying, "I have done as thou didst command me."  
10.1 Then I looked, and behold, on the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in form resembling a throne.  
10.2 And he said to the man clothed in linen, "Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim; fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city." And he went in before my eyes.  
10.3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in; and a cloud filled the inner court. 
10.4 And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherubim to the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of the LORD. 
10.5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks. 
10.6 And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," he went in and stood beside a wheel.  
10.7 And a cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out. 
10.8 The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings. 
10.9 And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling chrysolite.  
10.10 And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel. 
10.11 When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced the others followed without turning as they went. 
10.12 And their rims, and their spokes, and the wheels were full of eyes round about -- the wheels that the four of them had. 
10.13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels. 
10.14 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
10.15 And the cherubim mounted up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the river Chebar.  
10.16 And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them. 
10.17 When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them. 
10.18 Then the glory of the LORD went forth from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.  
10.19 And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight as they went forth, with the wheels beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the house of the LORD; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. 
10.20 These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.  
10.21 Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings the semblance of human hands. 
10.22 And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the very faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. They went every one straight forward. 
11.1 The Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the house of the LORD, which faces east. And behold, at the door of the gateway there were twenty-five men; and I saw among them Ja-azani'ah the son of Azzur, and Pelati'ah the son of Benai'ah, princes of the people.  
11.2 And he said to me, "Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity and who give wicked counsel in this city; 
11.3 who say, `The time is not near to build houses; this city is the caldron, and we are the flesh.' 
11.4 Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man." 
11.5 And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and he said to me, "Say, Thus says the LORD: So you think, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.  
11.6 You have multiplied your slain in this city, and have filled its streets with the slain. 
11.7 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron; but you shall be brought forth out of the midst of it. 
11.8 You have feared the sword; and I will bring the sword upon you, says the Lord GOD. 
11.9 And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and give you into the hands of foreigners, and execute judgments upon you. 
11.10 You shall fall by the sword; I will judge you at the border of Israel; and you shall know that I am the LORD. 
11.11 This city shall not be your caldron, nor shall you be the flesh in the midst of it; I will judge you at the border of Israel; 
11.12 and you shall know that I am the LORD; for you have not walked in my statutes, nor executed my ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you." 
11.13 And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelati'ah the son of Benai'ah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, "Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"  
11.14 And the word of the LORD came to me:  
11.15 "Son of man, your brethren, even your brethren, your fellow exiles, the whole house of Israel, all of them, are those of whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, `They have gone far from the LORD; to us this land is given for a possession.' 
11.16 Therefore say, `Thus says the Lord GOD: Though I removed them far off among the nations, and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.' 
11.17 Therefore say, `Thus says the Lord GOD: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.' 
11.18 And when they come there, they will remove from it all its detestable things and all its abominations. 
11.19 And I will give them one heart, and put a new spirit within them; I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and give them a heart of flesh, 
11.20 that they may walk in my statutes and keep my ordinances and obey them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
11.21 But as for those whose heart goes after their detestable things and their abominations, I will requite their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord GOD." 
11.22 Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.  
11.23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. 
11.24 And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chalde'a, to the exiles. Then the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
11.25 And I told the exiles all the things that the LORD had showed me. 
12.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
12.2 "Son of man, you dwell in the midst of a rebellious house, who have eyes to see, but see not, who have ears to hear, but hear not; 
12.3 for they are a rebellious house. Therefore, son of man, prepare for yourself an exile's baggage, and go into exile by day in their sight; you shall go like an exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house. 
12.4 You shall bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile; and you shall go forth yourself at evening in their sight, as men do who must go into exile. 
12.5 Dig through the wall in their sight, and go out through it. 
12.6 In their sight you shall lift the baggage upon your shoulder, and carry it out in the dark; you shall cover your face, that you may not see the land; for I have made you a sign for the house of Israel." 
12.7 And I did as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day, as baggage for exile, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my own hands; I went forth in the dark, carrying my outfit upon my shoulder in their sight.  
12.8 In the morning the word of the LORD came to me:  
12.9 "Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, `What are you doing?' 
12.10 Say to them, `Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are in it.' 
12.11 Say, `I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.' 
12.12 And the prince who is among them shall lift his baggage upon his shoulder in the dark, and shall go forth; he shall dig through the wall and go out through it; he shall cover his face, that he may not see the land with his eyes. 
12.13 And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chalde'ans, yet he shall not see it; and he shall die there. 
12.14 And I will scatter toward every wind all who are round about him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will unsheathe the sword after them. 
12.15 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries. 
12.16 But I will let a few of them escape from the sword, from famine and pestilence, that they may confess all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the LORD." 
12.17 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me:  
12.18 "Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink water with trembling and with fearfulness; 
12.19 and say of the people of the land, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink water in dismay, because their land will be stripped of all it contains, on account of the violence of all those who dwell in it. 
12.20 And the inhabited cities shall be laid waste, and the land shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD." 
12.21 And the word of the LORD came to me:  
12.22 "Son of man, what is this proverb that you have about the land of Israel, saying, `The days grow long, and every vision comes to nought'? 
12.23 Tell them therefore, `Thus says the Lord GOD: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel.' But say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfilment of every vision. 
12.24 For there shall be no more any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel. 
12.25 But I the LORD will speak the word which I will speak, and it will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, but in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it, says the Lord GOD." 
12.26 Again the word of the LORD came to me:  
12.27 "Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, `The vision that he sees is for many days hence, and he prophesies of times far off.' 
12.28 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: None of my words will be delayed any longer, but the word which I speak will be performed, says the Lord GOD." 
13.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
13.2 "Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, prophesy and say to those who prophesy out of their own minds: `Hear the word of the LORD!' 
13.3 Thus says the Lord GOD, Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! 
13.4 Your prophets have been like foxes among ruins, O Israel. 
13.5 You have not gone up into the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel, that it might stand in battle in the day of the LORD. 
13.6 They have spoken falsehood and divined a lie; they say, `Says the LORD,' when the LORD has not sent them, and yet they expect him to fulfil their word. 
13.7 Have you not seen a delusive vision, and uttered a lying divination, whenever you have said, `Says the LORD,' although I have not spoken?" 
13.8 Therefore thus says the Lord God: "Because you have uttered delusions and seen lies, therefore behold, I am against you, says the Lord GOD.  
13.9 My hand will be against the prophets who see delusive visions and who give lying divinations; they shall not be in the council of my people, nor be enrolled in the register of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD. 
13.10 Because, yea, because they have misled my people, saying, `Peace,' when there is no peace; and because, when the people build a wall, these prophets daub it with whitewash; 
13.11 say to those who daub it with whitewash that it shall fall! There will be a deluge of rain, great hailstones will fall, and a stormy wind break out; 
13.12 and when the wall falls, will it not be said to you, `Where is the daubing with which you daubed it?' 
13.13 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath; and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to destroy it. 
13.14 And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be laid bare; when it falls, you shall perish in the midst of it; and you shall know that I am the LORD. 
13.15 Thus will I spend my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have daubed it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who daubed it, 
13.16 the prophets of Israel who prophesied concerning Jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her, when there was no peace, says the Lord GOD. 
13.17 "And you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own minds; prophesy against them  
13.18 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the women who sew magic bands upon all wrists, and make veils for the heads of persons of every stature, in the hunt for souls! Will you hunt down souls belonging to my people, and keep other souls alive for your profit? 
13.19 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, putting to death persons who should not die and keeping alive persons who should not live, by your lies to my people, who listen to lies. 
13.20 "Wherefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your magic bands with which you hunt the souls, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls that you hunt go free like birds.  
13.21 Your veils also I will tear off, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand as prey; and you shall know that I am the LORD. 
13.22 Because you have disheartened the righteous falsely, although I have not disheartened him, and you have encouraged the wicked, that he should not turn from his wicked way to save his life;
13.23 therefore you shall no more see delusive visions nor practice divination; I will deliver my people out of your hand. Then you will know that I am the LORD." 
14.1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me; and sat before me.  
14.2 And the word of the LORD came to me: 
14.3 "Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces; should I let myself be inquired of at all by them? 
14.4 Therefore speak to them, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him myself because of the multitude of his idols, 
14.5 that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols. 
14.6 "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Repent and turn away from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.  
14.7 For any one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, who separates himself from me, taking his idols into his heart and putting the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to a prophet to inquire for himself of me, I the LORD will answer him myself; 
14.8 and I will set my face against that man, I will make him a sign and a byword and cut him off from the midst of my people; and you shall know that I am the LORD. 
14.9 And if the prophet be deceived and speak a word, I, the LORD, have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 
14.10 And they shall bear their punishment -- the punishment of the prophet and the punishment of the inquirer shall be alike -- 
14.11 that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, nor defile themselves any more with all their transgressions, but that they may be my people and I may be their God, says the Lord GOD." 
14.12 And the word of the LORD came to me:  
14.13 "Son of man, when a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it, and break its staff of bread and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast, 
14.14 even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness, says the Lord GOD. 
14.15 If I cause wild beasts to pass through the land, and they ravage it, and it be made desolate, so that no man may pass through because of the beasts; 
14.16 even if these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters; they alone would be delivered, but the land would be desolate. 
14.17 Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Let a sword go through the land; and I cut off from it man and beast; 
14.18 though these three men were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they alone would be delivered. 
14.19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my wrath upon it with blood, to cut off from it man and beast; 
14.20 even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, says the Lord GOD, they would deliver neither son nor daughter; they would deliver but their own lives by their righteousness. 
14.21 "For thus says the Lord GOD: How much more when I send upon Jerusalem my four sore acts of judgment, sword, famine, evil beasts, and pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast!  
14.22 Yet, if there should be left in it any survivors to lead out sons and daughters, when they come forth to you, and you see their ways and their doings, you will be consoled for the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, for all that I have brought upon it. 
14.23 They will console you, when you see their ways and their doings; and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, says the Lord GOD." 
15.1 And the word of the LORD came to me:  
15.2 "Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
15.3 Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do men take a peg from it to hang any vessel on? 
15.4 Lo, it is given to the fire for fuel; when the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything? 
15.5 Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing; how much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything! 
15.6 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
15.7 And I will set my face against them; though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them; and you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them. 
15.8 And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, says the Lord GOD." 
16.1 Again the word of the LORD came to me:  
16.2 "Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations, 
16.3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite. 
16.4 And as for your birth, on the day you were born your navel string was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor swathed with bands. 
16.5 No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you; but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, on the day that you were born. 
16.6 "And when I passed by you, and saw you weltering in your blood, I said to you in your blood, `Live,  
16.7 and grow up like a plant of the field.' And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full maidenhood; your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare. 
16.8 "When I passed by you again and looked upon you, behold, you were at the age for love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yea, I plighted my troth to you and entered into a covenant with you, says the Lord GOD, and you became mine.  
16.9 Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you, and anointed you with oil. 
16.10 I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with leather, I swathed you in fine linen and covered you with silk. 
16.11 And I decked you with ornaments, and put bracelets on your arms, and a chain on your neck. 
16.12 And I put a ring on your nose, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head. 
16.13 Thus you were decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and embroidered cloth; you ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful, and came to regal estate. 
16.14 And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor which I had bestowed upon you, says the Lord GOD. 
16.15 "But you trusted in your beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and lavished your harlotries on any passer-by.  
16.16 You took some of your garments, and made for yourself gaily decked shrines, and on them played the harlot; the like has never been, nor ever shall be. 
16.17 You also took your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the harlot; 
16.18 and you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them. 
16.19 Also my bread which I gave you -- I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey -- you set before them for a pleasing odor, says the Lord GOD. 
16.20 And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your harlotries so small a matter 
16.21 that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them? 
16.22 And in all your abominations and your harlotries you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, weltering in your blood. 
16.23 "And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! says the Lord GOD),  
16.24 you built yourself a vaulted chamber, and made yourself a lofty place in every square; 
16.25 at the head of every street you built your lofty place and prostituted your beauty, offering yourself to any passer-by, and multiplying your harlotry. 
16.26 You also played the harlot with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your harlotry, to provoke me to anger. 
16.27 Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you, and diminished your allotted portion, and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior. 
16.28 You played the harlot also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yea, you played the harlot with them, and still you were not satisfied. 
16.29 You multiplied your harlotry also with the trading land of Chalde'a; and even with this you were not satisfied. 
16.30 "How lovesick is your heart, says the Lord GOD, seeing you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen harlot;  
16.31 building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a harlot, because you scorned hire. 
16.32 Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband! 
16.33 Men give gifts to all harlots; but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side for your harlotries. 
16.34 So you were different from other women in your harlotries: none solicited you to play the harlot; and you gave hire, while no hire was given to you; therefore you were different. 
16.35 "Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:  
16.36 Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your shame was laid bare and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotries with your lovers, and because of all your idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them, 
16.37 therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you loathed; I will gather them against you from every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. 
16.38 And I will judge you as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy. 
16.39 And I will give you into the hand of your lovers, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places; they shall strip you of your clothes and take your fair jewels, and leave you naked and bare. 
16.40 They shall bring up a host against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords. 
16.41 And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women; I will make you stop playing the harlot, and you shall also give hire no more. 
16.42 So will I satisfy my fury on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you; I will be calm, and will no more be angry. 
16.43 Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things; therefore, behold, I will requite your deeds upon your head, says the Lord GOD. "Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations?  
16.44 Behold, every one who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you, `Like mother, like daughter.' 
16.45 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. 
16.46 And your elder sister is Sama'ria, who lived with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters. 
16.47 Yet you were not content to walk in their ways, or do according to their abominations; within a very little time you were more corrupt than they in all your ways. 
16.48 As I live, says the Lord GOD, your sister Sodom and her daughters have not done as you and your daughters have done. 
16.49 Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, surfeit of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. 
16.50 They were haughty, and did abominable things before me; therefore I removed them, when I saw it. 
16.51 Sama'ria has not committed half your sins; you have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations which you have committed. 
16.52 Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have made judgment favorable to your sisters; because of your sins in which you acted more abominably than they, they are more in the right than you. So be ashamed, you also, and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous. 
16.53 "I will restore their fortunes, both the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and the fortunes of Sama'ria and her daughters, and I will restore your own fortunes in the midst of them,  
16.54 that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all that you have done, becoming a consolation to them. 
16.55 As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate, and Sama'ria and her daughters shall return to their former estate; and you and your daughters shall return to your former estate. 
16.56 Was not your sister Sodom a byword in your mouth in the day of your pride, 
16.57 before your wickedness was uncovered? Now you have become like her an object of reproach for the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors, and for the daughters of the Philistines, those round about who despise you. 
16.58 You bear the penalty of your lewdness and your abominations, says the LORD. 
16.59 "Yea, thus says the Lord GOD: I will deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant,  
16.60 yet I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish with you an everlasting covenant. 
16.61 Then you will remember your ways, and be ashamed when I take your sisters, both your elder and your younger, and give them to you as daughters, but not on account of the covenant with you. 
16.62 I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall know that I am the LORD, 
16.63 that you may remember and be confounded, and never open your mouth again because of your shame, when I forgive you all that you have done, says the Lord GOD." 
17.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
17.2 "Son of man, propound a riddle, and speak an allegory to the house of Israel; 
17.3 say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, rich in plumage of many colors, came to Lebanon and took the top of the cedar; 
17.4 he broke off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of trade, and set it in a city of merchants. 
17.5 Then he took of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil; he placed it beside abundant waters. He set it like a willow twig, 
17.6 and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine, and its branches turned toward him, and its roots remained where it stood. So it became a vine, and brought forth branches and put forth foliage. 
17.7 "But there was another great eagle with great wings and much plumage; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him that he might water it. From the bed where it was planted  
17.8 he transplanted it to good soil by abundant waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, and become a noble vine. 
17.9 Say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots and cut off its branches, so that all its fresh sprouting leaves wither? It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it from its roots. 
17.10 Behold, when it is transplanted, will it thrive? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind strikes it -- wither away on the bed where it grew?" 
17.11 Then the word of the LORD came to me:  
17.12 "Say now to the rebellious house, Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took her king and her princes and brought them to him to Babylon. 
17.13 And he took one of the seed royal and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. (The chief men of the land he had taken away, 
17.14 that the kingdom might be humble and not lift itself up, and that by keeping his covenant it might stand.) 
17.15 But he rebelled against him by sending ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can a man escape who does such things? Can he break the covenant and yet escape? 
17.16 As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant with him he broke, in Babylon he shall die. 
17.17 Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company will not help him in war, when mounds are cast up and siege walls built to cut off many lives. 
17.18 Because he despised the oath and broke the covenant, because he gave his hand and yet did all these things, he shall not escape. 
17.19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely my oath which he despised, and my covenant which he broke, I will requite upon his head. 
17.20 I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for the treason he has committed against me. 
17.21 And all the pick of his troops shall fall by the sword, and the survivors shall be scattered to every wind; and you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken." 
17.22 Thus says the Lord GOD: "I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it out; I will break off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I myself will plant it upon a high and lofty mountain;  
17.23 on the mountain height of Israel will I plant it, that it may bring forth boughs and bear fruit, and become a noble cedar; and under it will dwell all kinds of beasts; in the shade of its branches birds of every sort will nest. 
17.24 And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD bring low the high tree, and make high the low tree, dry up the green tree, and make the dry tree flourish. I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it." 
18.1 The word of the LORD came to me again:  
18.2 "What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, `The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge'? 
18.3 As I live, says the Lord GOD, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel. 
18.4 Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins shall die. 
18.5 "If a man is righteous and does what is lawful and right --  
18.6 if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman in her time of impurity, 
18.7 does not oppress any one, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, 
18.8 does not lend at interest or take any increase, withholds his hand from iniquity, executes true justice between man and man, 
18.9 walks in my statutes, and is careful to observe my ordinances -- he is righteous, he shall surely live, says the Lord GOD. 
18.10 "If he begets a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood,  
18.11 who does none of these duties, but eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor's wife, 
18.12 oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination, 
18.13 lends at interest, and takes increase; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominable things; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself. 
18.14 "But if this man begets a son who sees all the sins which his father has done, and fears, and does not do likewise,  
18.15 who does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife, 
18.16 does not wrong any one, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment, 
18.17 withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or increase, observes my ordinances, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live. 
18.18 As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity. 
18.19 "Yet you say, `Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?' When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live.  
18.20 The soul that sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. 
18.21 "But if a wicked man turns away from all his sins which he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is lawful and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.  
18.22 None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness which he has done he shall live. 
18.23 Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, says the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live? 
18.24 But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and does the same abominable things that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds which he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, he shall die. 
18.25 "Yet you say, `The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?  
18.26 When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die for it; for the iniquity which he has committed he shall die. 
18.27 Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is lawful and right, he shall save his life. 
18.28 Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
18.29 Yet the house of Israel says, `The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just? 
18.30 "Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin.  
18.31 Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed against me, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel? 
18.32 For I have no pleasure in the death of any one, says the Lord GOD; so turn, and live." 
19.1 And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,  
19.2 and say: What a lioness was your mother among lions! She couched in the midst of young lions, rearing her whelps.
19.3 And she brought up one of her whelps; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.
19.4 The nations sounded an alarm against him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
19.5 When she saw that she was baffled, that her hope was lost, she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion.
19.6 He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.
19.7 And he ravaged their strongholds, and laid waste their cities; and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring.
19.8 Then the nations set against him snares on every side; they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.
19.9 With hooks they put him in a cage, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into custody, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
19.10 Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard transplanted by the water, fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water.
19.11 Its strongest stem became a ruler's scepter; it towered aloft among the thick boughs; it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.
19.12 But the vine was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the east wind dried it up; its fruit was stripped off, its strong stem was withered; the fire consumed it.
19.13 Now it is transplanted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.
19.14 And fire has gone out from its stem, has consumed its branches and fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for a ruler. This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.  
20.1 In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.  
20.2 And the word of the LORD came to me: 
20.3 "Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD, Is it to inquire of me that you come? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you. 
20.4 Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then let them know the abominations of their fathers, 
20.5 and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, making myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God. 
20.6 On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands. 
20.7 And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God. 
20.8 But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.  
20.9 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they dwelt, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt. 
20.10 So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness. 
20.11 I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live. 
20.12 Moreover I gave them my sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I the LORD sanctify them. 
20.13 But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did not walk in my statutes but rejected my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned. "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them.  
20.14 But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out. 
20.15 Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands, 
20.16 because they rejected my ordinances and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols. 
20.17 Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness. 
20.18 "And I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.  
20.19 I the LORD am your God; walk in my statutes, and be careful to observe my ordinances, 
20.20 and hallow my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I the LORD am your God. 
20.21 But the children rebelled against me; they did not walk in my statutes, and were not careful to observe my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live; they profaned my sabbaths. "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.  
20.22 But I withheld my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out. 
20.23 Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries, 
20.24 because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols. 
20.25 Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life; 
20.26 and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first-born, that I might horrify them; I did it that they might know that I am the LORD. 
20.27 "Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this again your fathers blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me.  
20.28 For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their soothing odors, and there they poured out their drink offerings. 
20.29 (I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So its name is called Bamah to this day.) 
20.30 Wherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go astray after their detestable things? 
20.31 When you offer your gifts and sacrifice your sons by fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you. 
20.32 "What is in your mind shall never happen -- the thought, `Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.'  
20.33 "As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you.  
20.34 I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out; 
20.35 and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face. 
20.36 As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord GOD. 
20.37 I will make you pass under the rod, and I will let you go in by number. 
20.38 I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
20.39 "As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.  
20.40 "For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land; there I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred offerings.  
20.41 As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations. 
20.42 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country which I swore to give to your fathers. 
20.43 And there you shall remember your ways and all the doings with which you have polluted yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed. 
20.44 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD." 
20.45 And the word of the LORD came to me:  
20.46 "Son of man, set your face toward the south, preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb; 
20.47 say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it. 
20.48 All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched." 
20.49 Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! they are saying of me, `Is he not a maker of allegories?'" 
21.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
21.2 "Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries; prophesy against the land of Israel 
21.3 and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked. 
21.4 Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from south to north; 
21.5 and all flesh shall know that I the LORD have drawn my sword out of its sheath; it shall not be sheathed again. 
21.6 Sigh therefore, son of man; sigh with breaking heart and bitter grief before their eyes. 
21.7 And when they say to you, `Why do you sigh?' you shall say, `Because of the tidings. When it comes, every heart will melt and all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes and it will be fulfilled,'" says the Lord GOD. 
21.8 And the word of the LORD came to me:  
21.9 "Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished,
21.10 sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Or do we make mirth? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood. 
21.11 So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be handled; it is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer. 
21.12 Cry and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel; they are delivered over to the sword with my people. Smite therefore upon your thigh. 
21.13 For it will not be a testing -- what could it do if you despise the rod?" says the Lord GOD. 
21.14 "Prophesy therefore, son of man; clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yea thrice, the sword for those to be slain; it is the sword for the great slaughter, which encompasses them,  
21.15 that their hearts may melt, and many fall at all their gates. I have given the glittering sword; ah! it is made like lightning, it is polished for slaughter. 
21.16 Cut sharply to right and left where your edge is directed. 
21.17 I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken." 
21.18 The word of the LORD came to me again:  
21.19 "Son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall come forth from the same land. And make a signpost, make it at the head of the way to a city; 
21.20 mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah and to Jerusalem the fortified. 
21.21 For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the teraphim, he looks at the liver. 
21.22 Into his right hand comes the lot for Jerusalem, to open the mouth with a cry, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers. 
21.23 But to them it will seem like a false divination; they have sworn solemn oaths; but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be captured. 
21.24 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear -- because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in them.  
21.25 And you, O unhallowed wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment, 
21.26 thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban, and take off the crown; things shall not remain as they are; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high. 
21.27 A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it; there shall not be even a trace of it until he comes whose right it is; and to him I will give it. 
21.28 "And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; say, A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter, it is polished to glitter and to flash like lightning --  
21.29 while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you -- to be laid on the necks of the unhallowed wicked, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment. 
21.30 Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. 
21.31 And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hands of brutal men, skilful to destroy. 
21.32 You shall be fuel for the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be no more remembered; for I the LORD have spoken." 
22.1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  
22.2 "And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then declare to her all her abominable deeds. 
22.3 You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself! 
22.4 You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and defiled by the idols which you have made; and you have brought your day near, the appointed time of your years has come. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mocking to all the countries. 
22.5 Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult. 
22.6 "Behold, the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood.  
22.7 Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you. 
22.8 You have despised my holy things, and profaned my sabbaths. 
22.9 There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and men in you who eat upon the mountains; men commit lewdness in your midst. 
22.10 In you men uncover their fathers' nakedness; in you they humble women who are unclean in their impurity. 
22.11 One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another in you defiles his sister, his father's daughter. 
22.12 In you men take bribes to shed blood; you take interest and increase and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; and you have forgotten me, says the Lord GOD. 
22.13 "Behold, therefore, I strike my hands together at the dishonest gain which you have made, and at the blood which has been in the midst of you.  
22.14 Can your courage endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it. 
22.15 I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the countries, and I will consume your filthiness out of you. 
22.16 And I shall be profaned through you in the sight of the nations; and you shall know that I am the LORD." 
22.17 And the word of the LORD came to me:  
22.18 "Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them, silver and bronze and tin and iron and lead in the furnace, have become dross. 
22.19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have all become dross, therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. 
22.20 As men gather silver and bronze and iron and lead and tin into a furnace, to blow the fire upon it in order to melt it; so I will gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will put you in and melt you. 
22.21 I will gather you and blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it. 
22.22 As silver is melted in a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it; and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out my wrath upon you." 
22.23 And the word of the LORD came to me:  
22.24 "Son of man, say to her, You are a land that is not cleansed, or rained upon in the day of indignation. 
22.25 Her princes in the midst of her are like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in the midst of her. 
22.26 Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. 
22.27 Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain. 
22.28 And her prophets have daubed for them with whitewash, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, `Thus says the Lord GOD,' when the LORD has not spoken. 
22.29 The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery; they have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without redress. 
22.30 And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found none. 
22.31 Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath; their way have I requited upon their heads, says the Lord GOD." 
23.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
23.2 "Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother; 
23.3 they played the harlot in Egypt; they played the harlot in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms handled. 
23.4 Oho'lah was the name of the elder and Ohol'ibah the name of her sister. They became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oho'lah is Sama'ria, and Ohol'ibah is Jerusalem. 
23.5 "Oho'lah played the harlot while she was mine; and she doted on her lovers the Assyrians,  
23.6 warriors clothed in purple, governors and commanders, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses. 
23.7 She bestowed her harlotries upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and she defiled herself with all the idols of every one on whom she doted. 
23.8 She did not give up her harlotry which she had practiced since her days in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her. 
23.9 Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted. 
23.10 These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword; and she became a byword among women, when judgment had been executed upon her. 
23.11 "Her sister Ohol'ibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt than she in her doting and in her harlotry, which was worse than that of her sister.  
23.12 She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and commanders, warriors clothed in full armor, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men. 
23.13 And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way. 
23.14 But she carried her harlotry further; she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chalde'ans portrayed in vermilion, 
23.15 girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, a picture of Babylonians whose native land was Chalde'a. 
23.16 When she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them in Chalde'a. 
23.17 And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lust; and after she was polluted by them, she turned from them in disgust. 
23.18 When she carried on her harlotry so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned from her sister. 
23.19 Yet she increased her harlotry, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the harlot in the land of Egypt 
23.20 and doted upon her paramours there, whose members were like those of asses, and whose issue was like that of horses. 
23.21 Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed your young breasts." 
23.22 Therefore, O Ohol'ibah, thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I will rouse against you your lovers from whom you turned in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side:  
23.23 the Babylonians and all the Chalde'ans, Pekod and Sho'a and Ko'a, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and commanders all of them, officers and warriors, all of them riding on horses. 
23.24 And they shall come against you from the north with chariots and wagons and a host of peoples; they shall set themselves against you on every side with buckler, shield, and helmet, and I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments. 
23.25 And I will direct my indignation against you, that they may deal with you in fury. They shall cut off your nose and your ears, and your survivors shall fall by the sword. They shall seize your sons and your daughters, and your survivors shall be devoured by fire. 
23.26 They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your fine jewels. 
23.27 Thus I will put an end to your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to the Egyptians or remember them any more. 
23.28 For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust; 
23.29 and they shall deal with you in hatred, and take away all the fruit of your labor, and leave you naked and bare, and the nakedness of your harlotry shall be uncovered. Your lewdness and your harlotry 
23.30 have brought this upon you, because you played the harlot with the nations, and polluted yourself with their idols. 
23.31 You have gone the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand. 
23.32 Thus says the Lord GOD: "You shall drink your sister's cup which is deep and large; you shall be laughed at and held in derision, for it contains much;
23.33 you will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. A cup of horror and desolation, is the cup of your sister Sama'ria;
23.34 you shall drink it and drain it out, and pluck out your hair, and tear your breasts; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD. 
23.35 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, therefore bear the consequences of your lewdness and harlotry." 
23.36 The LORD said to me: "Son of man, will you judge Oho'lah and Ohol'ibah? Then declare to them their abominable deeds.  
23.37 For they have committed adultery, and blood is upon their hands; with their idols they have committed adultery; and they have even offered up to them for food the sons whom they had borne to me. 
23.38 Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary on the same day and profaned my sabbaths. 
23.39 For when they had slaughtered their children in sacrifice to their idols, on the same day they came into my sanctuary to profane it. And lo, this is what they did in my house. 
23.40 They even sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger was sent, and lo, they came. For them you bathed yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments; 
23.41 you sat upon a stately couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil. 
23.42 The sound of a carefree multitude was with her; and with men of the common sort drunkards were brought from the wilderness; and they put bracelets upon the hands of the women, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. 
23.43 "Then I said, Do not men now commit adultery when they practice harlotry with her?  
23.44 For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a harlot. Thus they went in to Oho'lah and to Ohol'ibah to commit lewdness. 
23.45 But righteous men shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses, and with the sentence of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is upon their hands." 
23.46 For thus says the Lord GOD: "Bring up a host against them, and make them an object of terror and a spoil.  
23.47 And the host shall stone them and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses. 
23.48 Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done. 
23.49 And your lewdness shall be requited upon you, and you shall bear the penalty for your sinful idolatry; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD." 
24.1 In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:  
24.2 "Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day. 
24.3 And utter an allegory to the rebellious house and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Set on the pot, set it on, pour in water also;
24.4 put in it the pieces of flesh, all the good pieces, the thigh and the shoulder; fill it with choice bones.
24.5 Take the choicest one of the flock, pile the logs under it; boil its pieces, seethe also its bones in it.
24.6 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose rust is in it, and whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, without making any choice.  
24.7 For the blood she has shed is still in the midst of her; she put it on the bare rock, she did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust. 
24.8 To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered. 
24.9 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great. 
24.10 Heap on the logs, kindle the fire, boil well the flesh, and empty out the broth, and let the bones be burned up. 
24.11 Then set it empty upon the coals, that it may become hot, and its copper may burn, that its filthiness may be melted in it, its rust consumed. 
24.12 In vain I have wearied myself; its thick rust does not go out of it by fire. 
24.13 Its rust is your filthy lewdness. Because I would have cleansed you and you were not cleansed from your filthiness, you shall not be cleansed any more till I have satisfied my fury upon you. 
24.14 I the LORD have spoken; it shall come to pass, I will do it; I will not go back, I will not spare, I will not repent; according to your ways and your doings I will judge you, says the Lord GOD." 
24.15 Also the word of the LORD came to me:  
24.16 "Son of man, behold, I am about to take the delight of your eyes away from you at a stroke; yet you shall not mourn or weep nor shall your tears run down. 
24.17 Sigh, but not aloud; make no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban, and put your shoes on your feet; do not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of mourners." 
24.18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded. 
24.19 And the people said to me, "Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are acting thus?"  
24.20 Then I said to them, "The word of the LORD came to me: 
24.21 `Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword. 
24.22 And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of mourners. 
24.23 Your turbans shall be on your heads and your shoes on your feet; you shall not mourn or weep, but you shall pine away in your iniquities and groan to one another. 
24.24 Thus shall Ezekiel be to you a sign; according to all that he has done you shall do. When this comes, then you will know that I am the Lord GOD.' 
24.25 "And you, son of man, on the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and glory, the delight of their eyes and their heart's desire, and also their sons and daughters,  
24.26 on that day a fugitive will come to you to report to you the news. 
24.27 On that day your mouth will be opened to the fugitive, and you shall speak and be no longer dumb. So you will be a sign to them; and they will know that I am the LORD." 
25.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
25.2 "Son of man, set your face toward the Ammonites, and prophesy against them. 
25.3 Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Because you said, `Aha!' over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when it went into exile; 
25.4 therefore I am handing you over to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. 
25.5 I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and the cities of the Ammonites a fold for flocks. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
25.6 For thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the malice within you against the land of Israel, 
25.7 therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against you, and will hand you over as spoil to the nations; and I will cut you off from the peoples and will make you perish out of the countries; I will destroy you. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
25.8 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Moab said, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,  
25.9 therefore I will lay open the flank of Moab from the cities on its frontier, the glory of the country, Beth-jesh'imoth, Ba'al-me'on, and Kiriatha'im. 
25.10 I will give it along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, that it may be remembered no more among the nations, 
25.11 and I will execute judgments upon Moab. Then they will know that I am the LORD. 
25.12 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because Edom acted revengefully against the house of Judah and has grievously offended in taking vengeance upon them,  
25.13 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, I will stretch out my hand against Edom, and cut off from it man and beast; and I will make it desolate; from Teman even to Dedan they shall fall by the sword. 
25.14 And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel; and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my wrath; and they shall know my vengeance, says the Lord GOD. 
25.15 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the Philistines acted revengefully and took vengeance with malice of heart to destroy in never-ending enmity;  
25.16 therefore thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will stretch out my hand against the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cher'ethites, and destroy the rest of the seacoast. 
25.17 I will execute great vengeance upon them with wrathful chastisements. Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay my vengeance upon them." 
26.1 In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:  
26.2 "Son of man, because Tyre said concerning Jerusalem, `Aha, the gate of the peoples is broken, it has swung open to me; I shall be replenished, now that she is laid waste,' 
26.3 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will bring up many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves. 
26.4 They shall destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers; and I will scrape her soil from her, and make her a bare rock. 
26.5 She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for the spreading of nets; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD; and she shall become a spoil to the nations; 
26.6 and her daughters on the mainland shall be slain by the sword. Then they will know that I am the LORD. 
26.7 "For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring upon Tyre from the north Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses and chariots, and with horsemen and a host of many soldiers.  
26.8 He will slay with the sword your daughters on the mainland; he will set up a siege wall against you, and throw up a mound against you, and raise a roof of shields against you. 
26.9 He will direct the shock of his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers. 
26.10 His horses will be so many that their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen and wagons and chariots, when he enters your gates as one enters a city which has been breached. 
26.11 With the hoofs of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people with the sword; and your mighty pillars will fall to the ground. 
26.12 They will make a spoil of your riches and a prey of your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; your stones and timber and soil they will cast into the midst of the waters. 
26.13 And I will stop the music of your songs, and the sound of your lyres shall be heard no more. 
26.14 I will make you a bare rock; you shall be a place for the spreading of nets; you shall never be rebuilt; for I the LORD have spoken, says the Lord GOD. 
26.15 "Thus says the Lord GOD to Tyre: Will not the coastlands shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when slaughter is made in the midst of you?  
26.16 Then all the princes of the sea will step down from their thrones, and remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments; they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit upon the ground and tremble every moment, and be appalled at you. 
26.17 And they will raise a lamentation over you, and say to you, `How you have vanished from the seas, O city renowned, that was mighty on the sea, you and your inhabitants, who imposed your terror on all the mainland!
26.18 Now the isles tremble on the day of your fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea are dismayed at your passing.'
26.19 "For thus says the Lord GOD: When I make you a city laid waste, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I bring up the deep over you, and the great waters cover you,  
26.20 then I will thrust you down with those who descend into the Pit, to the people of old, and I will make you to dwell in the nether world, among primeval ruins, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you will not be inhabited or have a place in the land of the living. 
26.21 I will bring you to a dreadful end, and you shall be no more; though you be sought for, you will never be found again, says the Lord GOD." 
27.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
27.2 "Now you, son of man, raise a lamentation over Tyre, 
27.3 and say to Tyre, who dwells at the entrance to the sea, merchant of the peoples on many coastlands, thus says the Lord GOD: "O Tyre, you have said, `I am perfect in beauty.'
27.4 Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders made perfect your beauty.
27.5 They made all your planks of fir trees from Senir; they took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.
27.6 Of oaks of Bashan they made your oars; they made your deck of pines from the coasts of Cyprus, inlaid with ivory.
27.7 Of fine embroidered linen from Egypt was your sail, serving as your ensign; blue and purple from the coasts of Eli'shah was your awning.
27.8 The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers; skilled men of Zemer were in you, they were your pilots.
27.9 The elders of Gebal and her skilled men were in you, caulking your seams; all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you, to barter for your wares.
27.10 "Persia and Lud and Put were in your army as your men of war; they hung the shield and helmet in you; they gave you splendor.  
27.11 The men of Arvad and Helech were upon your walls round about, and men of Gamad were in your towers; they hung their shields upon your walls round about; they made perfect your beauty. 
27.12 "Tarshish trafficked with you because of your great wealth of every kind; silver, iron, tin, and lead they exchanged for your wares.  
27.13 Javan, Tubal, and Meshech traded with you; they exchanged the persons of men and vessels of bronze for your merchandise. 
27.14 Beth-togar'mah exchanged for your wares horses, war horses, and mules. 
27.15 The men of Rhodes traded with you; many coastlands were your own special markets, they brought you in payment ivory tusks and ebony. 
27.16 Edom trafficked with you because of your abundant goods; they exchanged for your wares emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and agate. 
27.17 Judah and the land of Israel traded with you; they exchanged for your merchandise wheat, olives and early figs, honey, oil, and balm. 
27.18 Damascus trafficked with you for your abundant goods, because of your great wealth of every kind; wine of Helbon, and white wool, 
27.19 and wine from Uzal they exchanged for your wares; wrought iron, cassia, and calamus were bartered for your merchandise. 
27.20 Dedan traded with you in saddlecloths for riding. 
27.21 Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your favored dealers in lambs, rams, and goats; in these they trafficked with you. 
27.22 The traders of Sheba and Ra'amah traded with you; they exchanged for your wares the best of all kinds of spices, and all precious stones, and gold. 
27.23 Haran, Canneh, Eden, Asshur, and Chilmad traded with you. 
27.24 These traded with you in choice garments, in clothes of blue and embroidered work, and in carpets of colored stuff, bound with cords and made secure; in these they traded with you. 
27.25 The ships of Tarshish traveled for you with your merchandise. "So you were filled and heavily laden in the heart of the seas.
27.26 Your rowers have brought you out into the high seas. The east wind has wrecked you in the heart of the seas.
27.27 Your riches, your wares, your merchandise, your mariners and your pilots, your caulkers, your dealers in merchandise, and all your men of war who are in you, with all your company that is in your midst, sink into the heart of the seas on the day of your ruin.
27.28 At the sound of the cry of your pilots the countryside shakes,
27.29 and down from their ships come all that handle the oar. The mariners and all the pilots of the sea stand on the shore
27.30 and wail aloud over you, and cry bitterly. They cast dust on their heads and wallow in ashes;
27.31 they make themselves bald for you, and gird themselves with sackcloth, and they weep over you in bitterness of soul, with bitter mourning.
27.32 In their wailing they raise a lamentation for you, and lament over you: `Who was ever destroyed like Tyre in the midst of the sea?
27.33 When your wares came from the seas, you satisfied many peoples; with your abundant wealth and merchandise you enriched the kings of the earth.
27.34 Now you are wrecked by the seas, in the depths of the waters; your merchandise and all your crew have sunk with you.
27.35 All the inhabitants of the coastlands are appalled at you; and their kings are horribly afraid, their faces are convulsed.
27.36 The merchants among the peoples hiss at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more for ever.'" 
28.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
28.2 "Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Because your heart is proud, and you have said, `I am a god, I sit in the seat of the gods, in the heart of the seas,' yet you are but a man, and no god, though you consider yourself as wise as a god --
28.3 you are indeed wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you;
28.4 by your wisdom and your understanding you have gotten wealth for yourself, and have gathered gold and silver into your treasuries;
28.5 by your great wisdom in trade you have increased your wealth, and your heart has become proud in your wealth --
28.6 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "Because you consider yourself as wise as a god,
28.7 therefore, behold, I will bring strangers upon you, the most terrible of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and defile your splendor.
28.8 They shall thrust you down into the Pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas.
28.9 Will you still say, `I am a god,' in the presence of those who slay you, though you are but a man, and no god, in the hands of those who wound you?
28.10 You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of foreigners; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD."
28.11 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me:  
28.12 "Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord GOD: "You were the signet of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
28.13 You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, carnelian, topaz, and jasper, chrysolite, beryl, and onyx, sapphire, carbuncle, and emerald; and wrought in gold were your settings and your engravings. On the day that you were created they were prepared.
28.14 With an anointed guardian cherub I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God; in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.
28.15 You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.
28.16 In the abundance of your trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned; so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God, and the guardian cherub drove you out from the midst of the stones of fire.
28.17 Your heart was proud because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom for the sake of your splendor. I cast you to the ground; I exposed you before kings, to feast their eyes on you.
28.18 By the multitude of your iniquities, in the unrighteousness of your trade you profaned your sanctuaries; so I brought forth fire from the midst of you; it consumed you, and I turned you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who saw you.
28.19 All who know you among the peoples are appalled at you; you have come to a dreadful end and shall be no more for ever."
28.20 The word of the LORD came to me:  
28.21 "Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her 
28.22 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, and I will manifest my glory in the midst of you. And they shall know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments in her, and manifest my holiness in her;
28.23 for I will send pestilence into her, and blood into her streets; and the slain shall fall in the midst of her, by the sword that is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.
28.24 "And for the house of Israel there shall be no more a brier to prick or a thorn to hurt them among all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.  
28.25 "Thus says the Lord GOD: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and manifest my holiness in them in the sight of the nations, then they shall dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.  
28.26 And they shall dwell securely in it, and they shall build houses and plant vineyards. They shall dwell securely, when I execute judgments upon all their neighbors who have treated them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God." 
29.1 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:  
29.2 "Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt; 
29.3 speak, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of his streams, that says, `My Nile is my own; I made it.'
29.4 I will put hooks in your jaws, and make the fish of your streams stick to your scales; and I will draw you up out of the midst of your streams, with all the fish of your streams which stick to your scales.
29.5 And I will cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all the fish of your streams; you shall fall upon the open field, and not be gathered and buried. To the beasts of the earth and to the birds of the air I have given you as food.
29.6 "Then all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD. Because you have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel;  
29.7 when they grasped you with the hand, you broke, and tore all their shoulders; and when they leaned upon you, you broke, and made all their loins to shake; 
29.8 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will bring a sword upon you, and will cut off from you man and beast; 
29.9 and the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste. Then they will know that I am the LORD. "Because you said, `The Nile is mine, and I made it,'  
29.10 therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Ethiopia. 
29.11 No foot of man shall pass through it, and no foot of beast shall pass through it; it shall be uninhabited forty years. 
29.12 And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated countries; and her cities shall be a desolation forty years among cities that are laid waste. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries. 
29.13 "For thus says the Lord GOD: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered;  
29.14 and I will restore the fortunes of Egypt, and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their origin; and there they shall be a lowly kingdom. 
29.15 It shall be the most lowly of the kingdoms, and never again exalt itself above the nations; and I will make them so small that they will never again rule over the nations. 
29.16 And it shall never again be the reliance of the house of Israel, recalling their iniquity, when they turn to them for aid. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD." 
29.17 In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:  
29.18 "Son of man, Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder was rubbed bare; yet neither he nor his army got anything from Tyre to pay for the labor that he had performed against it. 
29.19 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon; and he shall carry off its wealth and despoil it and plunder it; and it shall be the wages for his army. 
29.20 I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which he labored, because they worked for me, says the Lord GOD. 
29.21 "On that day I will cause a horn to spring forth to the house of Israel, and I will open your lips among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD."  
30.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
30.2 "Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: "Wail, `Alas for the day!'
30.3 For the day is near, the day of the LORD is near; it will be a day of clouds, a time of doom for the nations.
30.4 A sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain fall in Egypt, and her wealth is carried away, and her foundations are torn down.
30.5 Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all Arabia, and Libya, and the people of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. 
30.6 "Thus says the LORD: Those who support Egypt shall fall, and her proud might shall come down; from Migdol to Syene they shall fall within her by the sword, says the Lord GOD.
30.7 And she shall be desolated in the midst of desolated countries and her cities shall be in the midst of cities that are laid waste.
30.8 Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have set fire to Egypt, and all her helpers are broken.
30.9 "On that day swift messengers shall go forth from me to terrify the unsuspecting Ethiopians; and anguish shall come upon them on the day of Egypt's doom; for, lo, it comes!  
30.10 "Thus says the Lord GOD:  I will put an end to the wealth of Egypt, by the hand of Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon.
30.11 He and his people with him, the most terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
30.12 And I will dry up the Nile, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; I will bring desolation upon the land and everything in it, by the hand of foreigners; I, the LORD, have spoken.
30.13 "Thus says the Lord GOD:  I will destroy the idols, and put an end to the images, in Memphis; there shall no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt; so I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
30.14 I will make Pathros a desolation, and will set fire to Zo'an, and will execute acts of judgment upon Thebes.
30.15 And I will pour my wrath upon Pelusium, the stronghold of Egypt, and cut off the multitude of Thebes.
30.16 And I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusium shall be in great agony; Thebes shall be breached, and its walls broken down.
30.17 The young men of On and of Pibe'seth shall fall by the sword; and the women shall go into captivity.
30.18 At Tehaph'nehes the day shall be dark, when I break there the dominion of Egypt, and her proud might shall come to an end; she shall be covered by a cloud, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
30.19 Thus I will execute acts of judgment upon Egypt. Then they will know that I am the LORD."
30.20 In the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:  
30.21 "Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and lo, it has not been bound up, to heal it by binding it with a bandage, so that it may become strong to wield the sword. 
30.22 Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, both the strong arm and the one that was broken; and I will make the sword fall from his hand. 
30.23 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them throughout the lands. 
30.24 And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand; but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him like a man mortally wounded. 
30.25 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh shall fall; and they shall know that I am the LORD. When I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, he shall stretch it out against the land of Egypt; 
30.26 and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the countries. Then they will know that I am the LORD." 
31.1 In the eleventh year, in the third month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:  
31.2 "Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitude: "Whom are you like in your greatness?
31.3 Behold, I will liken you to a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches and forest shade, and of great height, its top among the clouds.
31.4 The waters nourished it, the deep made it grow tall, making its rivers flow round the place of its planting, sending forth its streams to all the trees of the forest.
31.5 So it towered high above all the trees of the forest; its boughs grew large and its branches long, from abundant water in its shoots.
31.6 All the birds of the air made their nests in its boughs; under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.
31.7 It was beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its roots went down to abundant waters.
31.8 The cedars in the garden of God could not rival it, nor the fir trees equal its boughs; the plane trees were as nothing compared with its branches; no tree in the garden of God was like it in beauty.
31.9 I made it beautiful in the mass of its branches, and all the trees of Eden envied it, that were in the garden of God.
31.10 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because it towered high and set its top among the clouds, and its heart was proud of its height,  
31.11 I will give it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with it as its wickedness deserves. I have cast it out. 
31.12 Foreigners, the most terrible of the nations, will cut it down and leave it. On the mountains and in all the valleys its branches will fall, and its boughs will lie broken in all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth will go from its shadow and leave it. 
31.13 Upon its ruin will dwell all the birds of the air, and upon its branches will be all the beasts of the field. 
31.14 All this is in order that no trees by the waters may grow to lofty height or set their tops among the clouds, and that no trees that drink water may reach up to them in height; for they are all given over to death, to the nether world among mortal men, with those who go down to the Pit. 
31.15 "Thus says the Lord GOD: When it goes down to Sheol I will make the deep mourn for it, and restrain its rivers, and many waters shall be stopped; I will clothe Lebanon in gloom for it, and all the trees of the field shall faint because of it.  
31.16 I will make the nations quake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol with those who go down to the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, will be comforted in the nether world. 
31.17 They also shall go down to Sheol with it, to those who are slain by the sword; yea, those who dwelt under its shadow among the nations shall perish. 
31.18 Whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? You shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether world; you shall lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. "This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD."  
32.1 In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:  
32.2 "Son of man, raise a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him: "You consider yourself a lion among the nations, but you are like a dragon in the seas; you burst forth in your rivers, trouble the waters with your feet, and foul their rivers.
32.3 Thus says the Lord GOD: I will throw my net over you with a host of many peoples; and I will haul you up in my dragnet.
32.4 And I will cast you on the ground, on the open field I will fling you, and will cause all the birds of the air to settle on you, and I will gorge the beasts of the whole earth with you.
32.5 I will strew your flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with your carcass.
32.6 I will drench the land even to the mountains with your flowing blood; and the watercourses will be full of you.
32.7 When I blot you out, I will cover the heavens, and make their stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.
32.8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over you, and put darkness upon your land, says the Lord GOD.
32.9 "I will trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I carry you captive among the nations, into the countries which you have not known.  
32.10 I will make many peoples appalled at you, and their kings shall shudder because of you, when I brandish my sword before them; they shall tremble every moment, every one for his own life, on the day of your downfall. 
32.11 For thus says the Lord GOD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you. 
32.12 I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of mighty ones, all of them most terrible among the nations. "They shall bring to nought the pride of Egypt, and all its multitude shall perish.
32.13 I will destroy all its beasts from beside many waters; and no foot of man shall trouble them any more, nor shall the hoofs of beasts trouble them.
32.14 Then I will make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, says the Lord GOD.
32.15 When I make the land of Egypt desolate and when the land is stripped of all that fills it, when I smite all who dwell in it, then they will know that I am the LORD.
32.16 This is a lamentation which shall be chanted; the daughters of the nations shall chant it; over Egypt, and over all her multitude, shall they chant it, says the Lord GOD." 
32.17 In the twelfth year, in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me:  
32.18 "Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, and send them down, her and the daughters of majestic nations, to the nether world, to those who have gone down to the Pit: 
32.19 `Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.'
32.20 They shall fall amid those who are slain by the sword, and with her shall lie all her multitudes. 
32.21 The mighty chiefs shall speak of them, with their helpers, out of the midst of Sheol: `They have come down, they lie still, the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.' 
32.22 "Assyria is there, and all her company, their graves round about her, all of them slain, fallen by the sword;  
32.23 whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the Pit, and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living. 
32.24 "Elam is there, and all her multitude about her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised into the nether world, who spread terror in the land of the living, and they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.  
32.25 They have made her a bed among the slain with all her multitude, their graves round about her, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for terror of them was spread in the land of the living, and they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit; they are placed among the slain. 
32.26 "Meshech and Tubal are there, and all their multitude, their graves round about them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they spread terror in the land of the living.  
32.27 And they do not lie with the fallen mighty men of old who went down to Sheol with their weapons of war, whose swords were laid under their heads, and whose shields are upon their bones; for the terror of the mighty men was in the land of the living. 
32.28 So you shall be broken and lie among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword. 
32.29 "Edom is there, her kings and all her princes, who for all their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword; they lie with the uncircumcised, with those who go down to the Pit.  
32.30 "The princes of the north are there, all of them, and all the Sido'nians, who have gone down in shame with the slain, for all the terror which they caused by their might; they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.  
32.31 "When Pharaoh sees them, he will comfort himself for all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, says the Lord GOD.  
32.32 For he spread terror in the land of the living; therefore he shall be laid among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord GOD." 
33.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
33.2 "Son of man, speak to your people and say to them, If I bring the sword upon a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and make him their watchman; 
33.3 and if he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet and warns the people; 
33.4 then if any one who hears the sound of the trumpet does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood shall be upon his own head. 
33.5 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But if he had taken warning, he would have saved his life. 
33.6 But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, so that the people are not warned, and the sword comes, and takes any one of them; that man is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman's hand. 
33.7 "So you, son of man, I have made a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.  
33.8 If I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die, and you do not speak to warn the wicked to turn from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at your hand. 
33.9 But if you warn the wicked to turn from his way, and he does not turn from his way; he shall die in his iniquity, but you will have saved your life. 
33.10 "And you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Thus have you said: `Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we waste away because of them; how then can we live?'  
33.11 Say to them, As I live, says the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn back, turn back from your evil ways; for why will you die, O house of Israel? 
33.12 And you, son of man, say to your people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him when he transgresses; and as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall by it when he turns from his wickedness; and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness when he sins. 
33.13 Though I say to the righteous that he shall surely live, yet if he trusts in his righteousness and commits iniquity, none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in the iniquity that he has committed he shall die. 
33.14 Again, though I say to the wicked, `You shall surely die,' yet if he turns from his sin and does what is lawful and right, 
33.15 if the wicked restores the pledge, gives back what he has taken by robbery, and walks in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. 
33.16 None of the sins that he has committed shall be remembered against him; he has done what is lawful and right, he shall surely live. 
33.17 "Yet your people say, `The way of the Lord is not just'; when it is their own way that is not just.  
33.18 When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall die for it. 
33.19 And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does what is lawful and right, he shall live by it. 
33.20 Yet you say, `The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, I will judge each of you according to his ways." 
33.21 In the twelfth year of our exile, in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me and said, "The city has fallen."  
33.22 Now the hand of the LORD had been upon me the evening before the fugitive came; and he had opened my mouth by the time the man came to me in the morning; so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer dumb. 
33.23 The word of the LORD came to me:  
33.24 "Son of man, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying, `Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land; but we are many; the land is surely given us to possess.' 
33.25 Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: You eat flesh with the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood; shall you then possess the land? 
33.26 You resort to the sword, you commit abominations and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife; shall you then possess the land? 
33.27 Say this to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword; and him that is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured; and those who are in strongholds and in caves shall die by pestilence. 
33.28 And I will make the land a desolation and a waste; and her proud might shall come to an end; and the mountains of Israel shall be so desolate that none will pass through. 
33.29 Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I have made the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed. 
33.30 "As for you, son of man, your people who talk together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses, say to one another, each to his brother, `Come, and hear what the word is that comes forth from the LORD.'  
33.31 And they come to you as people come, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear what you say but they will not do it; for with their lips they show much love, but their heart is set on their gain. 
33.32 And, lo, you are to them like one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument, for they hear what you say, but they will not do it. 
33.33 When this comes -- and come it will! -- then they will know that a prophet has been among them." 
34.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
34.2 "Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the Lord GOD: Ho, shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep? 
34.3 You eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fatlings; but you do not feed the sheep. 
34.4 The weak you have not strengthened, the sick you have not healed, the crippled you have not bound up, the strayed you have not brought back, the lost you have not sought, and with force and harshness you have ruled them. 
34.5 So they were scattered, because there was no shepherd; and they became food for all the wild beasts. 
34.6 My sheep were scattered, they wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; my sheep were scattered over all the face of the earth, with none to search or seek for them. 
34.7 "Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:  
34.8 As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep have become a prey, and my sheep have become food for all the wild beasts, since there was no shepherd; and because my shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the shepherds have fed themselves, and have not fed my sheep; 
34.9 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: 
34.10 Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their hand, and put a stop to their feeding the sheep; no longer shall the shepherds feed themselves. I will rescue my sheep from their mouths, that they may not be food for them. 
34.11 "For thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.  
34.12 As a shepherd seeks out his flock when some of his sheep have been scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered on a day of clouds and thick darkness. 
34.13 And I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the fountains, and in all the inhabited places of the country. 
34.14 I will feed them with good pasture, and upon the mountain heights of Israel shall be their pasture; there they shall lie down in good grazing land, and on fat pasture they shall feed on the mountains of Israel. 
34.15 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord GOD. 
34.16 I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the crippled, and I will strengthen the weak, and the fat and the strong I will watch over; I will feed them in justice. 
34.17 "As for you, my flock, thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, rams and he-goats.  
34.18 Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture, that you must tread down with your feet the rest of your pasture; and to drink of clear water, that you must foul the rest with your feet? 
34.19 And must my sheep eat what you have trodden with your feet, and drink what you have fouled with your feet? 
34.20 "Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: Behold, I, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.  
34.21 Because you push with side and shoulder, and thrust at all the weak with your horns, till you have scattered them abroad, 
34.22 I will save my flock, they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. 
34.23 And I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd. 
34.24 And I, the LORD, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the LORD, have spoken. 
34.25 "I will make with them a covenant of peace and banish wild beasts from the land, so that they may dwell securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.  
34.26 And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will send down the showers in their season; they shall be showers of blessing. 
34.27 And the trees of the field shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke, and deliver them from the hand of those who enslaved them. 
34.28 They shall no more be a prey to the nations, nor shall the beasts of the land devour them; they shall dwell securely, and none shall make them afraid. 
34.29 And I will provide for them prosperous plantations so that they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land, and no longer suffer the reproach of the nations. 
34.30 And they shall know that I, the LORD their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, says the Lord GOD. 
34.31 And you are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, says the Lord GOD." 
35.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
35.2 "Son of man, set your face against Mount Se'ir, and prophesy against it, 
35.3 and say to it, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, Mount Se'ir, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you a desolation and a waste. 
35.4 I will lay your cities waste, and you shall become a desolation; and you shall know that I am the LORD. 
35.5 Because you cherished perpetual enmity, and gave over the people of Israel to the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, at the time of their final punishment; 
35.6 therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you; because you are guilty of blood, therefore blood shall pursue you. 
35.7 I will make Mount Se'ir a waste and a desolation; and I will cut off from it all who come and go. 
35.8 And I will fill your mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those slain with the sword shall fall. 
35.9 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
35.10 "Because you said, `These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will take possession of them,' -- although the LORD was there --  
35.11 therefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, I will deal with you according to the anger and envy which you showed because of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known among you, when I judge you. 
35.12 And you shall know that I, the LORD, have heard all the revilings which you uttered against the mountains of Israel, saying, `They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.' 
35.13 And you magnified yourselves against me with your mouth, and multiplied your words against me; I heard it. 
35.14 Thus says the Lord GOD: For the rejoicing of the whole earth I will make you desolate. 
35.15 As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so I will deal with you; you shall be desolate, Mount Se'ir, and all Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the LORD. 
36.1 "And you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD.  
36.2 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because the enemy said of you, `Aha!' and, `The ancient heights have become our possession,' 
36.3 therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Because, yea, because they made you desolate, and crushed you from all sides, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you became the talk and evil gossip of the people; 
36.4 therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations round about; 
36.5 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I speak in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who gave my land to themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might possess it and plunder it. 
36.6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I speak in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the reproach of the nations; 
36.7 therefore thus says the Lord GOD: I swear that the nations that are round about you shall themselves suffer reproach. 
36.8 "But you, O mountains of Israel, shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they will soon come home.  
36.9 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown; 
36.10 and I will multiply men upon you, the whole house of Israel, all of it; the cities shall be inhabited and the waste places rebuilt; 
36.11 and I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as in your former times, and will do more good to you than ever before. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
36.12 Yea, I will let men walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance, and you shall no longer bereave them of children. 
36.13 Thus says the Lord GOD: Because men say to you, `You devour men, and you bereave your nation of children,' 
36.14 therefore you shall no longer devour men and no longer bereave your nation of children, says the Lord GOD; 
36.15 and I will not let you hear any more the reproach of the nations, and you shall no longer bear the disgrace of the peoples and no longer cause your nation to stumble, says the Lord GOD." 
36.16 The word of the LORD came to me:  
36.17 "Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their doings; their conduct before me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity. 
36.18 So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood which they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it. 
36.19 I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; in accordance with their conduct and their deeds I judged them. 
36.20 But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that men said of them, `These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.' 
36.21 But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel caused to be profaned among the nations to which they came. 
36.22 "Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.  
36.23 And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations will know that I am the LORD, says the Lord GOD, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. 
36.24 For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land. 
36.25 I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. 
36.26 A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. 
36.27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances. 
36.28 You shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers; and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
36.29 And I will deliver you from all your uncleannesses; and I will summon the grain and make it abundant and lay no famine upon you. 
36.30 I will make the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field abundant, that you may never again suffer the disgrace of famine among the nations. 
36.31 Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominable deeds. 
36.32 It is not for your sake that I will act, says the Lord GOD; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel. 
36.33 "Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt.  
36.34 And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by. 
36.35 And they will say, `This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now inhabited and fortified.' 
36.36 Then the nations that are left round about you shall know that I, the LORD, have rebuilt the ruined places, and replanted that which was desolate; I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will do it. 
36.37 "Thus says the Lord GOD: This also I will let the house of Israel ask me to do for them: to increase their men like a flock.  
36.38 Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men. Then they will know that I am the LORD." 
37.1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley; it was full of bones.  
37.2 And he led me round among them; and behold, there were very many upon the valley; and lo, they were very dry. 
37.3 And he said to me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" And I answered, "O Lord GOD, thou knowest." 
37.4 Again he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 
37.5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. 
37.6 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the LORD." 
37.7 So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.  
37.8 And as I looked, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them; but there was no breath in them. 
37.9 Then he said to me, "Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live." 
37.10 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great host. 
37.11 Then he said to me, "Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, `Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.'  
37.12 Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people; and I will bring you home into the land of Israel. 
37.13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. 
37.14 And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land; then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken, and I have done it, says the LORD." 
37.15 The word of the LORD came to me:  
37.16 "Son of man, take a stick and write on it, `For Judah, and the children of Israel associated with him'; then take another stick and write upon it, `For Joseph (the stick of E'phraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him'; 
37.17 and join them together into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. 
37.18 And when your people say to you, `Will you not show us what you mean by these?' 
37.19 say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (which is in the hand of E'phraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him; and I will join with it the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand. 
37.20 When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes, 
37.21 then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all sides, and bring them to their own land; 
37.22 and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms. 
37.23 They shall not defile themselves any more with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions; but I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
37.24 "My servant David shall be king over them; and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall follow my ordinances and be careful to observe my statutes.  
37.25 They shall dwell in the land where your fathers dwelt that I gave to my servant Jacob; they and their children and their children's children shall dwell there for ever; and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. 
37.26 I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will bless them and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 
37.27 My dwelling place shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
37.28 Then the nations will know that I the LORD sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary is in the midst of them for evermore." 
38.1 The word of the LORD came to me:  
38.2 "Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him 
38.3 and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal; 
38.4 and I will turn you about, and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great company, all of them with buckler and shield, wielding swords; 
38.5 Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet; 
38.6 Gomer and all his hordes; Beth-togar'mah from the uttermost parts of the north with all his hordes -- many peoples are with you. 
38.7 "Be ready and keep ready, you and all the hosts that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them.  
38.8 After many days you will be mustered; in the latter years you will go against the land that is restored from war, the land where people were gathered from many nations upon the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste; its people were brought out from the nations and now dwell securely, all of them. 
38.9 You will advance, coming on like a storm, you will be like a cloud covering the land you and all your hordes, and many peoples with you. 
38.10 "Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme  
38.11 and say, `I will go up against the land of unwalled villages; I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates'; 
38.12 to seize spoil and carry off plunder; to assail the waste places which are now inhabited, and the people who were gathered from the nations, who have gotten cattle and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth. 
38.13 Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its villages will say to you, `Have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to seize great spoil?' 
38.14 "Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day when my people Israel are dwelling securely, you will bestir yourself  
38.15 and come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great host, a mighty army; 
38.16 you will come up against my people Israel, like a cloud covering the land. In the latter days I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me, when through you, O Gog, I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. 
38.17 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Are you he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel, who in those days prophesied for years that I would bring you against them?  
38.18 But on that day, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, says the Lord GOD, my wrath will be roused. 
38.19 For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare, On that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 
38.20 the fish of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the ground, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall quake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground. 
38.21 I will summon every kind of terror against Gog, says the Lord GOD; every man's sword will be against his brother. 
38.22 With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him; and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples that are with him, torrential rains and hailstones, fire and brimstone. 
38.23 So I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD. 
39.1 "And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal;  
39.2 and I will turn you about and drive you forward, and bring you up from the uttermost parts of the north, and lead you against the mountains of Israel; 
39.3 then I will strike your bow from your left hand, and will make your arrows drop out of your right hand. 
39.4 You shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, you and all your hordes and the peoples that are with you; I will give you to birds of prey of every sort and to the wild beasts to be devoured. 
39.5 You shall fall in the open field; for I have spoken, says the Lord GOD. 
39.6 I will send fire on Magog and on those who dwell securely in the coastlands; and they shall know that I am the LORD. 
39.7 "And my holy name I will make known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let my holy name be profaned any more; and the nations shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.  
39.8 Behold, it is coming and it will be brought about, says the Lord GOD. That is the day of which I have spoken. 
39.9 "Then those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go forth and make fires of the weapons and burn them, shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, handpikes and spears, and they will make fires of them for seven years;  
39.10 so that they will not need to take wood out of the field or cut down any out of the forests, for they will make their fires of the weapons; they will despoil those who despoiled them, and plunder those who plundered them, says the Lord GOD. 
39.11 "On that day I will give to Gog a place for burial in Israel, the Valley of the Travelers east of the sea; it will block the travelers, for there Gog and all his multitude will be buried; it will be called the Valley of Hamon-gog.  
39.12 For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them, in order to cleanse the land. 
39.13 All the people of the land will bury them; and it will redound to their honor on the day that I show my glory, says the Lord GOD. 
39.14 They will set apart men to pass through the land continually and bury those remaining upon the face of the land, so as to cleanse it; at the end of seven months they will make their search. 
39.15 And when these pass through the land and any one sees a man's bone, then he shall set up a sign by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog. 
39.16 (A city Hamo'nah is there also.) Thus shall they cleanse the land. 
39.17 "As for you, son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: Speak to the birds of every sort and to all beasts of the field, `Assemble and come, gather from all sides to the sacrificial feast which I am preparing for you, a great sacrificial feast upon the mountains of Israel, and you shall eat flesh and drink blood.  
39.18 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth -- of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan. 
39.19 And you shall eat fat till you are filled, and drink blood till you are drunk, at the sacrificial feast which I am preparing for you. 
39.20 And you shall be filled at my table with horses and riders, with mighty men and all kinds of warriors,' says the Lord GOD. 
39.21 "And I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations shall see my judgment which I have executed, and my hand which I have laid on them.  
39.22 The house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God, from that day forward. 
39.23 And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity, because they dealt so treacherously with me that I hid my face from them and gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they all fell by the sword. 
39.24 I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their transgressions, and hid my face from them. 
39.25 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.  
39.26 They shall forget their shame, and all the treachery they have practiced against me, when they dwell securely in their land with none to make them afraid, 
39.27 when I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them from their enemies' lands, and through them have vindicated my holiness in the sight of many nations. 
39.28 Then they shall know that I am the LORD their God because I sent them into exile among the nations, and then gathered them into their own land. I will leave none of them remaining among the nations any more; 
39.29 and I will not hide my face any more from them, when I pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord GOD." 
40.1 In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was conquered, on that very day, the hand of the LORD was upon me,  
40.2 and brought me in the visions of God into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city opposite me. 
40.3 When he brought me there, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like bronze, with a line of flax and a measuring reed in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway. 
40.4 And the man said to me, "Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your mind upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you; declare all that you see to the house of Israel." 
40.5 And behold, there was a wall all around the outside of the temple area, and the length of the measuring reed in the man's hand was six long cubits, each being a cubit and a handbreadth in length; so he measured the thickness of the wall, one reed; and the height, one reed.  
40.6 Then he went into the gateway facing east, going up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one reed deep; 
40.7 and the side rooms, one reed long, and one reed broad; and the space between the side rooms, five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the vestibule of the gate at the inner end, one reed. 
40.8 Then he measured the vestibule of the gateway, eight cubits; 
40.9 and its jambs, two cubits; and the vestibule of the gate was at the inner end. 
40.10 And there were three side rooms on either side of the east gate; the three were of the same size; and the jambs on either side were of the same size. 
40.11 Then he measured the breadth of the opening of the gateway, ten cubits; and the breadth of the gateway, thirteen cubits. 
40.12 There was a barrier before the side rooms, one cubit on either side; and the side rooms were six cubits on either side. 
40.13 Then he measured the gate from the back of the one side room to the back of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits, from door to door. 
40.14 He measured also the vestibule, twenty cubits; and round about the vestibule of the gateway was the court. 
40.15 From the front of the gate at the entrance to the end of the inner vestibule of the gate was fifty cubits. 
40.16 And the gateway had windows round about, narrowing inwards into their jambs in the side rooms, and likewise the vestibule had windows round about inside, and on the jambs were palm trees. 
40.17 Then he brought me into the outer court; and behold, there were chambers and a pavement, round about the court; thirty chambers fronted on the pavement.  
40.18 And the pavement ran along the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement. 
40.19 Then he measured the distance from the inner front of the lower gate to the outer front of the inner court, a hundred cubits. Then he went before me to the north,  
40.20 and behold, there was a gate which faced toward the north, belonging to the outer court. He measured its length and its breadth. 
40.21 Its side rooms, three on either side, and its jambs and its vestibule were of the same size as those of the first gate; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
40.22 And its windows, its vestibule, and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the gate which faced toward the east; and seven steps led up to it; and its vestibule was on the inside. 
40.23 And opposite the gate on the north, as on the east, was a gate to the inner court; and he measured from gate to gate, a hundred cubits. 
40.24 And he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate on the south; and he measured its jambs and its vestibule; they had the same size as the others.  
40.25 And there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule, like the windows of the others; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
40.26 And there were seven steps leading up to it, and its vestibule was on the inside; and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side. 
40.27 And there was a gate on the south of the inner court; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits. 
40.28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it was of the same size as the others;  
40.29 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
40.30 And there were vestibules round about, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad. 
40.31 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its jambs, and its stairway had eight steps. 
40.32 Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gate; it was of the same size as the others.  
40.33 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and there were windows round about in it and in its vestibule; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
40.34 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side; and its stairway had eight steps. 
40.35 Then he brought me to the north gate, and he measured it; it had the same size as the others.  
40.36 Its side rooms, its jambs, and its vestibule were of the same size as the others; and it had windows round about; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits. 
40.37 Its vestibule faced the outer court, and it had palm trees on its jambs, one on either side; and its stairway had eight steps. 
40.38 There was a chamber with its door in the vestibule of the gate, where the burnt offering was to be washed.  
40.39 And in the vestibule of the gate were two tables on either side, on which the burnt offering and the sin offering and the guilt offering were to be slaughtered. 
40.40 And on the outside of the vestibule at the entrance of the north gate were two tables; and on the other side of the vestibule of the gate were two tables. 
40.41 Four tables were on the inside, and four tables on the outside of the side of the gate, eight tables, on which the sacrifices were to be slaughtered. 
40.42 And there were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high, on which the instruments were to be laid with which the burnt offerings and the sacrifices were slaughtered. 
40.43 And hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened round about within. And on the tables the flesh of the offering was to be laid. 
40.44 Then he brought me from without into the inner court, and behold, there were two chambers in the inner court, one at the side of the north gate facing south, the other at the side of the south gate facing north.  
40.45 And he said to me, This chamber which faces south is for the priests who have charge of the temple, 
40.46 and the chamber which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, who alone among the sons of Levi may come near to the LORD to minister to him. 
40.47 And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was in front of the temple. 
40.48 Then he brought me to the vestibule of the temple and measured the jambs of the vestibule, five cubits on either side; and the breadth of the gate was fourteen cubits; and the sidewalls of the gate were three cubits on either side.  
40.49 The length of the vestibule was twenty cubits, and the breadth twelve cubits; and ten steps led up to it; and there were pillars beside the jambs on either side. 
41.1 Then he brought me to the nave, and measured the jambs; on each side six cubits was the breadth of the jambs.  
41.2 And the breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sidewalls of the entrance were five cubits on either side; and he measured the length of the nave forty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits. 
41.3 Then he went into the inner room and measured the jambs of the entrance, two cubits; and the breadth of the entrance, six cubits; and the sidewalls of the entrance, seven cubits. 
41.4 And he measured the length of the room, twenty cubits, and its breadth, twenty cubits, beyond the nave. And he said to me, This is the most holy place. 
41.5 Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits thick; and the breadth of the side chambers, four cubits, round about the temple.  
41.6 And the side chambers were in three stories, one over another, thirty in each story. There were offsets all around the wall of the temple to serve as supports for the side chambers, so that they should not be supported by the wall of the temple. 
41.7 And the side chambers became broader as they rose from story to story, corresponding to the enlargement of the offset from story to story round about the temple; on the side of the temple a stairway led upward, and thus one went up from the lowest story to the top story through the middle story. 
41.8 I saw also that the temple had a raised platform round about; the foundations of the side chambers measured a full reed of six long cubits. 
41.9 The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits; and the part of the platform which was left free was five cubits. Between the platform of the temple and the 
41.10 chambers of the court was a breadth of twenty cubits round about the temple on every side. 
41.11 And the doors of the side chambers opened on the part of the platform that was left free, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the part that was left free was five cubits round about. 
41.12 The building that was facing the temple yard on the west side was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length ninety cubits.  
41.13 Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long; and the yard and the building with its walls, a hundred cubits long;  
41.14 also the breadth of the east front of the temple and the yard, a hundred cubits. 
41.15 Then he measured the length of the building facing the yard which was at the west and its walls on either side, a hundred cubits.  The nave of the temple and the inner room and the outer vestibule  
41.16 were paneled and round about all three had windows with recessed frames. Over against the threshold the temple was paneled with wood round about, from the floor up to the windows (now the windows were covered), 
41.17 to the space above the door, even to the inner room, and on the outside. And on all the walls round about in the inner room and the nave were carved likenesses 
41.18 of cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. Every cherub had two faces: 
41.19 the face of a man toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on the whole temple round about; 
41.20 from the floor to above the door cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall. 
41.21 The doorposts of the nave were squared; and in front of the holy place was something resembling  
41.22 an altar of wood, three cubits high, two cubits long, and two cubits broad; its corners, its base, and its walls were of wood. He said to me, "This is the table which is before the LORD." 
41.23 The nave and the holy place had each a double door. 
41.24 The doors had two leaves apiece, two swinging leaves for each door. 
41.25 And on the doors of the nave were carved cherubim and palm trees, such as were carved on the walls; and there was a canopy of wood in front of the vestibule outside. 
41.26 And there were recessed windows and palm trees on either side, on the sidewalls of the vestibule. 
42.1 Then he led me out into the inner court, toward the north, and he brought me to the chambers which were opposite the temple yard and opposite the building on the north.  
42.2 The length of the building which was on the north side was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits. 
42.3 Adjoining the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and facing the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in three stories. 
42.4 And before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long, and their doors were on the north. 
42.5 Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers in the building. 
42.6 For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the outer court; hence the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones. 
42.7 And there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, fifty cubits long. 
42.8 For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite the temple were a hundred cubits long. 
42.9 Below these chambers was an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court, 
42.10 where the outside wall begins. On the south also, opposite the yard and opposite the building, there were chambers  
42.11 with a passage in front of them; they were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits and arrangements and doors. 
42.12 And below the south chambers was an entrance on the east side, where one enters the passage, and opposite them was a dividing wall. 
42.13 Then he said to me, "The north chambers and the south chambers opposite the yard are the holy chambers, where the priests who approach the LORD shall eat the most holy offerings; there they shall put the most holy offerings -- the cereal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering, for the place is holy.  
42.14 When the priests enter the holy place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy; they shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people." 
42.15 Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by the gate which faced east, and measured the temple area round about.  
42.16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed. 
42.17 Then he turned and measured the north side, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed. 
42.18 Then he turned and measured the south side, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed. 
42.19 Then he turned to the west side and measured, five hundred cubits by the measuring reed. 
42.20 He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall around it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, to make a separation between the holy and the common. 
43.1 Afterward he brought me to the gate, the gate facing east.  
43.2 And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the east; and the sound of his coming was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with his glory. 
43.3 And the vision I saw was like the vision which I had seen when he came to destroy the city, and like the vision which I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. 
43.4 As the glory of the LORD entered the temple by the gate facing east, 
43.5 the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple. 
43.6 While the man was standing beside me, I heard one speaking to me out of the temple;  
43.7 and he said to me, "Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the people of Israel for ever. And the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name, neither they, nor their kings, by their harlotry, and by the dead bodies of their kings, 
43.8 by setting their threshold by my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them. They have defiled my holy name by their abominations which they have committed, so I have consumed them in my anger. 
43.9 Now let them put away their idolatry and the dead bodies of their kings far from me, and I will dwell in their midst for ever. 
43.10 "And you, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple and its appearance and plan, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities.  
43.11 And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, portray the temple, its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, and its whole form; and make known to them all its ordinances and all its laws; and write it down in their sight, so that they may observe and perform all its laws and all its ordinances. 
43.12 This is the law of the temple: the whole territory round about upon the top of the mountain shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple. 
43.13 "These are the dimensions of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): its base shall be one cubit high, and one cubit broad, with a rim of one span around its edge. And this shall be the height of the altar:  
43.14 from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits, with a breadth of one cubit; 
43.15 and the altar hearth, four cubits; and from the altar hearth projecting upward, four horns, one cubit high. 
43.16 The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long by twelve broad. 
43.17 The ledge also shall be square, fourteen cubits long by fourteen broad, with a rim around it half a cubit broad, and its base one cubit round about. The steps of the altar shall face east." 
43.18 And he said to me, "Son of man, thus says the Lord GOD: These are the ordinances for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon it and for throwing blood against it,  
43.19 you shall give to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who draw near to me to minister to me, says the Lord GOD, a bull for a sin offering. 
43.20 And you shall take some of its blood, and put it on the four horns of the altar, and on the four corners of the ledge, and upon the rim round about; thus you shall cleanse the altar and make atonement for it. 
43.21 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and it shall be burnt in the appointed place belonging to the temple, outside the sacred area. 
43.22 And on the second day you shall offer a he-goat without blemish for a sin offering; and the altar shall be cleansed, as it was cleansed with the bull. 
43.23 When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a bull without blemish and a ram from the flock without blemish. 
43.24 You shall present them before the LORD, and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the LORD. 
43.25 For seven days you shall provide daily a goat for a sin offering; also a bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish, shall be provided. 
43.26 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it, and so consecrate it. 
43.27 And when they have completed these days, then from the eighth day onward the priests shall offer upon the altar your burnt offerings and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, says the Lord GOD." 
44.1 Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces east; and it was shut.  
44.2 And he said to me, "This gate shall remain shut; it shall not be opened, and no one shall enter by it; for the LORD, the God of Israel, has entered by it; therefore it shall remain shut. 
44.3 Only the prince may sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by way of the vestibule of the gate, and shall go out by the same way." 
44.4 Then he brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple; and I looked, and behold, the glory of the LORD filled the temple of the LORD; and I fell upon my face.  
44.5 And the LORD said to me, "Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears all that I shall tell you concerning all the ordinances of the temple of the LORD and all its laws; and mark well those who may be admitted to the temple and all those who are to be excluded from the sanctuary. 
44.6 And say to the rebellious house, to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: O house of Israel, let there be an end to all your abominations, 
44.7 in admitting foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, to be in my sanctuary, profaning it, when you offer to me my food, the fat and the blood. You have broken my covenant, in addition to all your abominations. 
44.8 And you have not kept charge of my holy things; but you have set foreigners to keep my charge in my sanctuary. 
44.9 "Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart and flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the people of Israel, shall enter my sanctuary.  
44.10 But the Levites who went far from me, going astray from me after their idols when Israel went astray, shall bear their punishment. 
44.11 They shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the temple, and serving in the temple; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall attend on the people, to serve them. 
44.12 Because they ministered to them before their idols and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel, therefore I have sworn concerning them, says the Lord GOD, that they shall bear their punishment. 
44.13 They shall not come near to me, to serve me as priest, nor come near any of my sacred things and the things that are most sacred; but they shall bear their shame, because of the abominations which they have committed. 
44.14 Yet I will appoint them to keep charge of the temple, to do all its service and all that is to be done in it. 
44.15 "But the Levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept the charge of my sanctuary when the people of Israel went astray from me, shall come near to me to minister to me; and they shall attend on me to offer me the fat and the blood, says the Lord GOD;  
44.16 they shall enter my sanctuary, and they shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge. 
44.17 When they enter the gates of the inner court, they shall wear linen garments; they shall have nothing of wool on them, while they minister at the gates of the inner court, and within. 
44.18 They shall have linen turbans upon their heads, and linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with anything that causes sweat. 
44.19 And when they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall put off the garments in which they have been ministering, and lay them in the holy chambers; and they shall put on other garments, lest they communicate holiness to the people with their garments. 
44.20 They shall not shave their heads or let their locks grow long; they shall only trim the hair of their heads. 
44.21 No priest shall drink wine, when he enters the inner court. 
44.22 They shall not marry a widow, or a divorced woman, but only a virgin of the stock of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest. 
44.23 They shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and show them how to distinguish between the unclean and the clean. 
44.24 In a controversy they shall act as judges, and they shall judge it according to my judgments. They shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed feasts, and they shall keep my sabbaths holy. 
44.25 They shall not defile themselves by going near to a dead person; however, for father or mother, for son or daughter, for brother or unmarried sister they may defile themselves. 
44.26 After he is defiled, he shall count for himself seven days, and then he shall be clean. 
44.27 And on the day that he goes into the holy place, into the inner court, to minister in the holy place, he shall offer his sin offering, says the Lord GOD. 
44.28 "They shall have no inheritance; I am their inheritance: and you shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.  
44.29 They shall eat the cereal offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs. 
44.30 And the first of all the first fruits of all kinds, and every offering of all kinds from all your offerings, shall belong to the priests; you shall also give to the priests the first of your coarse meal, that a blessing may rest on your house. 
44.31 The priests shall not eat of anything, whether bird or beast, that has died of itself or is torn. 
45.1 "When you allot the land as a possession, you shall set apart for the LORD a portion of the land as a holy district, twenty-five thousand cubits long and twenty thousand cubits broad; it shall be holy throughout its whole extent.  
45.2 Of this a square plot of five hundred by five hundred cubits shall be for the sanctuary, with fifty cubits for an open space around it. 
45.3 And in the holy district you shall measure off a section twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand broad, in which shall be the sanctuary, the most holy place. 
45.4 It shall be the holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests, who minister in the sanctuary and approach the LORD to minister to him; and it shall be a place for their houses and a holy place for the sanctuary. 
45.5 Another section, twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand cubits broad, shall be for the Levites who minister at the temple, as their possession for cities to live in. 
45.6 "Alongside the portion set apart as the holy district you shall assign for the possession of the city an area five thousand cubits broad, and twenty-five thousand cubits long; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel.  
45.7 "And to the prince shall belong the land on both sides of the holy district and the property of the city, alongside the holy district and the property of the city, on the west and on the east, corresponding in length to one of the tribal portions, and extending from the western to the eastern boundary of the land.  
45.8 It is to be his property in Israel. And my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall let the house of Israel have the land according to their tribes. 
45.9 "Thus says the Lord GOD: Enough, O princes of Israel! Put away violence and oppression, and execute justice and righteousness; cease your evictions of my people, says the Lord GOD.  
45.10 "You shall have just balances, a just ephah, and a just bath.  
45.11 The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, the bath containing one tenth of a homer, and the ephah one tenth of a homer; the homer shall be the standard measure. 
45.12 The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; five shekels shall be five shekels, and ten shekels shall be ten shekels, and your mina shall be fifty shekels. 
45.13 "This is the offering which you shall make: one sixth of an ephah from each homer of wheat, and one sixth of an ephah from each homer of barley,  
45.14 and as the fixed portion of oil, one tenth of a bath from each cor (the cor, like the homer, contains ten baths); 
45.15 and one sheep from every flock of two hundred, from the families of Israel. This is the offering for cereal offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord GOD. 
45.16 All the people of the land shall give this offering to the prince in Israel. 
45.17 It shall be the prince's duty to furnish the burnt offerings, cereal offerings, and drink offerings, at the feasts, the new moons, and the sabbaths, all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel: he shall provide the sin offerings, cereal offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel. 
45.18 "Thus says the Lord GOD: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary.  
45.19 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the temple, the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and the posts of the gate of the inner court. 
45.20 You shall do the same on the seventh day of the month for any one who has sinned through error or ignorance; so you shall make atonement for the temple. 
45.21 "In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you shall celebrate the feast of the passover, and for seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten.  
45.22 On that day the prince shall provide for himself and all the people of the land a young bull for a sin offering. 
45.23 And on the seven days of the festival he shall provide as a burnt offering to the LORD seven young bulls and seven rams without blemish, on each of the seven days; and a he-goat daily for a sin offering. 
45.24 And he shall provide as a cereal offering an ephah for each bull, an ephah for each ram, and a hin of oil to each ephah. 
45.25 In the seventh month, on the fifteenth day of the month and for the seven days of the feast, he shall make the same provision for sin offerings, burnt offerings, and cereal offerings, and for the oil. 
46.1 "Thus says the Lord GOD: The gate of the inner court that faces east shall be shut on the six working days; but on the sabbath day it shall be opened and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened.  
46.2 The prince shall enter by the vestibule of the gate from without, and shall take his stand by the post of the gate. The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening. 
46.3 The people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons. 
46.4 The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish; 
46.5 and the cereal offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the cereal offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah. 
46.6 On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish; 
46.7 as a cereal offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah. 
46.8 When the prince enters, he shall go in by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way. 
46.9 "When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate; and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but each shall go out straight ahead.  
46.10 When they go in, the prince shall go in with them; and when they go out, he shall go out. 
46.11 "At the feasts and the appointed seasons the cereal offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah.  
46.12 When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him; and he shall offer his burnt offering or his peace offerings as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut. 
46.13 "He shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning he shall provide it.  
46.14 And he shall provide a cereal offering with it morning by morning, one sixth of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour, as a cereal offering to the LORD; this is the ordinance for the continual burnt offering. 
46.15 Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering. 
46.16 "Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons out of his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons, it is their property by inheritance.  
46.17 But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall revert to the prince; only his sons may keep a gift from his inheritance. 
46.18 The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property; he shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be dispossessed of his property." 
46.19 Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests; and there I saw a place at the extreme western end of them.  
46.20 And he said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the cereal offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so communicate holiness to the people." 
46.21 Then he brought me forth to the outer court, and led me to the four corners of the court; and in each corner of the court there was a court --  
46.22 in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long and thirty broad; the four were of the same size. 
46.23 On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows round about. 
46.24 Then he said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people." 
47.1 Then he brought me back to the door of the temple; and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east); and the water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar.  
47.2 Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me round on the outside to the outer gate, that faces toward the east; and the water was coming out on the south side. 
47.3 Going on eastward with a line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water; and it was ankle-deep.  
47.4 Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was up to the loins. 
47.5 Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through. 
47.6 And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?" Then he led me back along the bank of the river.  
47.7 As I went back, I saw upon the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other. 
47.8 And he said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah; and when it enters the stagnant waters of the sea, the water will become fresh. 
47.9 And wherever the river goes every living creature which swarms will live, and there will be very many fish; for this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes. 
47.10 Fishermen will stand beside the sea; from En-ge'di to En-eg'laim it will be a place for the spreading of nets; its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea. 
47.11 But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt. 
47.12 And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing." 
47.13 Thus says the Lord GOD: "These are the boundaries by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.  
47.14 And you shall divide it equally; I swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance. 
47.15 "This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, and on to Zedad,  
47.16 Bero'thah, Sib'raim (which lies on the border between Damascus and Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. 
47.17 So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-e'non, which is on the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This shall be the north side. 
47.18 "On the east side, the boundary shall run from Hazar-e'non between Hauran and Damascus; along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This shall be the east side.  
47.19 "On the south side, it shall run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-ka'desh, thence along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. This shall be the south side.  
47.20 "On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite the entrance of Hamath. This shall be the west side.  
47.21 "So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.  
47.22 You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens who reside among you and have begotten children among you. They shall be to you as native-born sons of Israel; with you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. 
47.23 In whatever tribe the alien resides, there you shall assign him his inheritance, says the Lord GOD. 
48.1 "These are the names of the tribes: Beginning at the northern border, from the sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, as far as Hazar-e'non (which is on the northern border of Damascus over against Hamath), and extending from the east side to the west, Dan, one portion.  
48.2 Adjoining the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west, Asher, one portion. 
48.3 Adjoining the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west, Naph'tali, one portion. 
48.4 Adjoining the territory of Naph'tali, from the east side to the west, Manas'seh, one portion. 
48.5 Adjoining the territory of Manas'seh, from the east side to the west, E'phraim, one portion. 
48.6 Adjoining the territory of E'phraim, from the east side to the west, Reuben, one portion. 
48.7 Adjoining the territory of Reuben, from the east side to the west, Judah, one portion. 
48.8 "Adjoining the territory of Judah, from the east side to the west, shall be the portion which you shall set apart, twenty-five thousand cubits in breadth, and in length equal to one of the tribal portions, from the east side to the west, with the sanctuary in the midst of it.  
48.9 The portion which you shall set apart for the LORD shall be twenty-five thousand cubits in length, and twenty thousand in breadth. 
48.10 These shall be the allotments of the holy portion: the priests shall have an allotment measuring twenty-five thousand cubits on the northern side, ten thousand cubits in breadth on the western side, ten thousand in breadth on the eastern side, and twenty-five thousand in length on the southern side, with the sanctuary of the LORD in the midst of it. 
48.11 This shall be for the consecrated priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept my charge, who did not go astray when the people of Israel went astray, as the Levites did. 
48.12 And it shall belong to them as a special portion from the holy portion of the land, a most holy place, adjoining the territory of the Levites. 
48.13 And alongside the territory of the priests, the Levites shall have an allotment twenty-five thousand cubits in length and ten thousand in breadth. The whole length shall be twenty-five thousand cubits and the breadth twenty thousand. 
48.14 They shall not sell or exchange any of it; they shall not alienate this choice portion of the land, for it is holy to the LORD. 
48.15 "The remainder, five thousand cubits in breadth and twenty-five thousand in length, shall be for ordinary use for the city, for dwellings and for open country. In the midst of it shall be the city;  
48.16 and these shall be its dimensions: the north side four thousand five hundred cubits, the south side four thousand five hundred, the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 
48.17 And the city shall have open land: on the north two hundred and fifty cubits, on the south two hundred and fifty, on the east two hundred and fifty, and on the west two hundred and fifty. 
48.18 The remainder of the length alongside the holy portion shall be ten thousand cubits to the east, and ten thousand to the west, and it shall be alongside the holy portion. Its produce shall be food for the workers of the city. 
48.19 And the workers of the city, from all the tribes of Israel, shall till it. 
48.20 The whole portion which you shall set apart shall be twenty-five thousand cubits square, that is, the holy portion together with the property of the city. 
48.21 "What remains on both sides of the holy portion and of the property of the city shall belong to the prince. Extending from the twenty-five thousand cubits of the holy portion to the east border, and westward from the twenty-five thousand cubits to the west border, parallel to the tribal portions, it shall belong to the prince. The holy portion with the sanctuary of the temple in its midst,  
48.22 and the property of the Levites and the property of the city, shall be in the midst of that which belongs to the prince. The portion of the prince shall lie between the territory of Judah and the territory of Benjamin. 
48.23 "As for the rest of the tribes: from the east side to the west, Benjamin, one portion.  
48.24 Adjoining the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, Simeon, one portion. 
48.25 Adjoining the territory of Simeon, from the east side to the west, Is'sachar, one portion. 
48.26 Adjoining the territory of Is'sachar, from the east side to the west, Zeb'ulun, one portion. 
48.27 Adjoining the territory of Zeb'ulun, from the east side to the west, Gad, one portion. 
48.28 And adjoining the territory of Gad to the south, the boundary shall run from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-ka'desh, thence along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. 
48.29 This is the land which you shall allot as an inheritance among the tribes of Israel, and these are their several portions, says the Lord GOD. 
48.30 "These shall be the exits of the city: On the north side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits by measure,  
48.31 three gates, the gate of Reuben, the gate of Judah, and the gate of Levi, the gates of the city being named after the tribes of Israel. 
48.32 On the east side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates, the gate of Joseph, the gate of Benjamin, and the gate of Dan. 
48.33 On the south side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits by measure, three gates, the gate of Simeon, the gate of Is'sachar, and the gate of Zeb'ulun. 
48.34 On the west side, which is to be four thousand five hundred cubits, three gates, the gate of Gad, the gate of Asher, and the gate of Naph'tali. 
48.35 The circumference of the city shall be eighteen thousand cubits. And the name of the city henceforth shall be, The LORD is there."
